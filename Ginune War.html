        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>RULES OF THE 2ND GINUNE POKEMON WAR:</u></h1>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">BASICS:</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>All Participating Warlords MUST use an Arceus equipped with a any of the Plates they currently posses.</li>
          <li>Warlords can only use ONE Plate Equipped Arceus at a time, but they can freely switch the Plates between battles.</li>
          <li>Battles can be Singles, Doubles, Multi or Royal as long as all parties involved agree, but if no agreement can be met, then it will default to a Singles Battle.</li>
          <li>When ALL of a Warlord's Pokemon equipped with a Plate have fainted in battle, they immediately lose, regardless of Score or overall advantage.</li>
          <li>The Plates will immediately exchange ownership to whoever defeated them, regardless of who won the battle.</li>
          <li>If a Warlord has lost all of their Plates to another, then they lose and their fate is in the hands of their opponent who can either SLAY them or RECRUIT them as a MINION.</li>
          <li>If you are SLAYED you are out of the Event completely. if you are RECRUITED as a MINION then you will serve under the Warlord (See Minions section for more details).</li>
          <li>Once you have gathered all 17 Plates, you are considered the winner of the 2nd War and will be granted a single wish from Arcues - the fate of the Ginune Region (and the ending of this story) will be in your hands.</li>
          <li>ALL BATTLES MUST BE SAVED - If a battle code is NOT presented then the battle will not count.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">ACTIONS & MOVEMENT:</h1>
        <div style="display: flex">
          <div flex=1 style="padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; font-size: 20px;">
            <p>-All Warlords will start in a Numbered Segment of the map of their choosing, regardless if someone else has chosen that spot as well.</p>
            <p>-Warlords & Minions can only Interact with others who are in the same Segment as them or any Segment directly adjacent to their current location.</p>
            <p>-Warlords & Minions can do only ONE of the following Actions per day with opposing Players - Battle or Trade</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Battle: Challenge an Adjacent Warlord / Minion to a battle, standard rules apply.</li>
              <li>Trade: Offer to trade Plate but ONLY if all parties involved have at least TWO Plates (i.e at no point have you physically let go of your link to the war). Trades are a verbal contract and once all parties have messaged Silver August regarding the trade, it is considered official. If one side fails to confirm the trade is considered a void of contract and the neglected recipient will be considered DEAD and their plates will go to the other involves parties.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>NOTE 1: if anyone involved in Trades are caught lying, cheating or attempting to fraud the system, then they themselves will be eliminated and have their spoils go to those victimized in the incident.</p>
            <p>NOTE 2: These rules only apply to those NOT in an alliance, see Alliance section for specific changes.</p>
            <p>-Once a Warlord has done their Action for the day, they CANNOT be Attacked or be involved in any Trade deals.</p>
            <p>-A Warlord CANNOT deny an opposing Warlord's call. Once PC'd they must answer the call. Warlords can freely attempt to negotiate a Trade over a Battle, or even attempt to bring in other Warlords, but if a deal cannot be made, the Action will default to a battle.</p>
            <p>NOTE: as an example, if a Warlord is challenged by another and attempts to offer a trade, but then attempts to call upon a 3rd party to "sweeten the deal" and negotiations still default into a Battle, the 3rd Party does not HAVE to battle and this is not considered their one Action of the day.</p>
            <p>-Warlords are NOT required to make an Action each day if they are able too.</p>
            <p>-Warlords can only move one space at a time across the map and can only move to segments of the map adjacent to their current location.</p>
            <p>-At the end of the day (or the latest point before you leave SL for the day) you MUST Skype/PC Silver August and tell him where you wish to move to on the map - Failure to do will default to no movement period.</p>
            <p>-New Days go into effect roughly 11:59am EST with 2:00am to 11:59am EST being considered "Peace Time" when no Actions can take place.</p>
            <p>-If a Warlord does not report to Silver for Actions or Movement or is not present on the site during "War Time" hours after 3 days, their character will be considered DEAD with any Plates they had being left at their current location to be taken by the first person to arrive on that Segment. If Multiple parties reach it at the same time, then standard Action options will apply. They can negotiate a deal or default to a Battle.</p>

      <div class="minions" style="font-size: 18px;">
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">MINIONS:</h1>
        <p>-Minions are a Warlord's allies and can serve as a way to initiate a Multi Battle or even split up to gather information. Once recruited they are expected to serve loyally but CAN betray their Warlord, however if within they are within 1 Zone of their Warlord, they can be slayed at ANY time (assuming they have equal or less Plates then their Warlord).</p>
        <p>-Warlords CANNOT give their Minion a Plate, as the Plate does not recognize the Minion as someone strong enough to fight along side.</p>
        <p>-Minions fight under their living Warlord's flag thus why the Plates will recognize them as "worthy" if conditions allow them to challenge another Warlord.</p>
        <p>-Minions CANNOT use a Plate (and thus an Arceus) unless they've won a Plate in battle. The Warlord rule does not apply so all of their Pokemon CAN faint in battle, but once they have a Plate, they MUST use it and if it faints, they immediately lose.</p>
        <p>-Minions MUST Travel with their Warlord unless order to split up and cannot engage in battle unless instructed to do so.</p>
        <p>-If a Warlord wishes to engage in a Multi-Battle with their Minion as their partner, the Minion MUST be in the same square or directly adjacent to both their Warlord and their opponent(s).</p>
        <p>NOTE: Minions CANNOT use a Plate in a Multi Battle unless it is one they've earned in battle and have yet to officially deliver to their Warlord. In this circumstance they CAN betray their Warlord and if victorious, all Plates from all Warlords involved will go to them.</p>
        <p>-Minions CANNOT be targeted for battles and can only challenge others if they have split up (1 Zone apart) from their Warlord. If victorious, all Plates collected will go to the Minion who is expected to return them to the Warlord, but if they acquire at least 1 more Plates then their Warlord. They can attempt to betray their Warlord. To do this,  they must return to their Warlord and challenge them, otherwise they will still be considered fighting under that Warlord's flag.</p>
        <p>-If a Minion loses a battle, their fate is once again in the hands of those who beat them, they can be taken hostage, slayed or recruited again. Any Plates they had will go to the one who defeated them.</p>
        <p>-When a Warlord is defeated by another Warlord, any Minions traveling with them will automatically be Recruited or Slayed by the opposing Warlord. Minions traveling AWAY from their Warlord will fall under different conditions depending on the situation:</p>
        <p>WITHOUT A PLATE: Minions continue to serve the flag of their fallen Warlord, without a living Warlord they cannot collect Plates AND can be challenged by anyone on the map. These Minions can freely travel across the map and get recruited by other Warlords. If challenged and defeated they can be Recruited or Slayed. However, if the Minion challenges and win, then THEY can be recruited automatically...though their fate after that is still up to the Warlord. If defeated, the Warlord can be recruited, slayed or simply rejected and forced to continue roaming. These battles still count as that Warlord's action for the day (outside of their alliances).</p>
        <p>WITH A PLATE: The Minion is effectively free. They keep the plates and can either continue to fight under their fallen Warlord's flag or re-raise their own.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="alliances">
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">ALLIANCES:</h1>
        <div style="font-size:18px;">
          <p>-Alliances, much like Trades are verbal contracts between 2 or more Warlords who agree to form a party, typically to not attack each other and attempt to watch each others backs. It is ONLY Verbal and can be broken at any time so like Minions, trust is key.</p>
          <p>-Alliance members CANNOT fight in your place when challenges, however they can be involved in a Multi-Battle if all sides agree.</p>
          <p>-You can freely trade Plates between members in your alliance without it taking up your daily action. HOWEVER, you must be within a Zone adjacent to them and you MUST have at least 2 Plates so that at no point where you technically not in possession of a plate. Minions can also trade between Warlords.</p>
          <p>-For the sake of avoiding scrutiny, please inform Silver August of any Alliances formed and when they are broken, so that you can officially receive any relevant perks.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="creating">
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">CREATING WITH THE PLATES:</h1>
        <div style="font-size: 18px;">
          <p>-Once someone has gathered at least 3 Plates, they will be offered the ability to create a Legendary Pokemon, but there are rules and limitations involved in this.</p>
          <p>-You cannot create the Legendary UNLESS you possess all the Plates of its corresponding Types. E.g. to make a Zekrom, you would need the Dragon, Electric and ANY other Plate.</p>
          <p>-Once you have made the Legendary, its form can only be maintained in this world if you bind it with one of the Plates that match its Type(s). This Plate MUST be equipped to the Legendary until they have fainted in battle</p>
          <p>-Legendary Pokemon created via the Plates function exactly like an Arceus and can be freely Traded since they are still technically JUST the Plate and not a REAL Legendary. The only difference is they do not display Arceus' personality.</p>
          <p>-Once the Legendary Pokemon is forged, the creation CANNOT be undone until they've fainted in battle. Once they faint, the Legendary Pokemon's essense returns to the Plate that will transfer ownership to whoever defeated them.</p>
          <p>The Battlefield is ever changing so NEW rules may come into effect midway through the war!<br>So keep a close eye on whats happening and be aware that anything can happen when dealing with the fragments of a god!</p>
