          <h2><U>GAME RULES</U></h2>
          <p>The Silver League’s competitive circuit is very similar to Smogon’s, although we don’t necessarily have “tiers”, just banned and unbanned. Unbanned Pokemon are anything OU and below by Smogon’s tiering system, and Banned Pokemon are anything in Ubers or above. In addition, we’ve made the following changes to the “unbanned” list:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Blaziken is allowed if it has Blaze. Speed Boost and by extension Blazikenite are banned.</li>
            <li>Magearna, Snorlax & Follow Me Jirachi are Banned from Double Battle formats.</li>
            <li>All pokemon exclusive Z-Moves are banned due to copyright reasons.</li>
            <li>Landorus-Incarnate is legal, but cannot have the ability Sheer Force.</li>
            <li>Swagger is legal, but usage in combination with Foul Play is banned.</li>
            <li>Baton Pass is Banned.</li>
            <li>Evasion-boosting items, Moves & Abilities are Banned.</li>
            <li>Standard Smogon clauses apply (Sleep Clause, Species Clause, OHKO Clause and Banned Items except Bright Powder)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2><u>STANCE ON CHEATING</u></h2>
          <p>Never, under any circumstances, will hacking EVER be tolerated on the Silver League. Every Pokemon you use on SL must be legitimately obtained. The entire point of the Silver League is to give legitimate players a place to battle with other legitimate players. If you are caught hacking, you WILL be immediately terminated. “Hacking” in this case covers save-manipulating programs (PokeSav, PokeGen and PKHex) and codes from cheating devices (Action Replay, Gameshark), but does NOT include RNG Manipulation.</p>
          <p>Given the inability to verify their legitimacy, Pokemon received through Wonder Trade are considered hacked as far as these rules are concerned. You can still use them for breeding, just don’t use them in battle.</p>
          <p>In the case of almost improbable Pokemon (such as Pokemon with Generation 3 move tutors), Unless you can provide photographic evidence of obtaining such a Pokemon legitimately, it is considered hacked as far as these rules are concerned.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2><u>BECOMING A GYM LEADER</u></h2>
          <p>The Silver League’s gym leaders are among the most respected battlers on the league. If you wish to join their ranks, you must first obtain at least 6 gym badges. From here, you must select a type that is not already occupied. You must then design a team that complies with one of the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Has at least FOUR (4) Pokémon of the gym type on it.</li>
            <li>Has at least THREE (3) Pokémon of the gym type on it with ONE (1) Pokémon that knows a move of the gym’s typing.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Mega Evolutions that change typing will count towards the required FOURTH Pokemon of that Type, so a Fighting Gym can use Mega Lopunny as the 4th Pokemon (and it would not need the Fighting move if for some reason you chose not to run one). Pokemon who LOSE their Gyms Type upon Mega Evolution count so long as they started out as that type and retain a Move of that Type.</p>
          <p>Once you’ve completed all the necessary steps, contact an Owner (denoted by the orange pawn on the chat) to start the process of becoming a gym leader.</p>
          <p>NOTE: Gym Leaders MUST be active on SL at least once a week, if they are unable to battle then they can request an appointed Gym Leader Sub fill in their place. If the Gym Leader fails to contact Silver August regarding their absence, OR if they rely on a Sub for an extensive period of time, they will run the risk of having their Gym Leader status revoked.</p>
          <p>GYM LEADER SUBS: Subs can be appointed in order to make sure there is a steady flow of open and active gyms, even if the Gym Leader is busy with real life (job, school, etc). GL Subs can fight in the Gym Leader's place but MUST follow the following rules:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Gym Leader Subs MUST use the same rules as the Gym Leader.</li>
            <li>Gym Leader Subs MUST be at least A-Rank.</li>
            <li>Gym Leader Subs MUST be approved by Silver August.</li>
            <li>Gym Leader Subs CANNOT battle in place of the Gym Leader unless the Gym Leader first contacts Silver August informing them of their upcoming absence or busy schedule.</li>
            <li>Gym Leaders are responsible for the actions and behavior of their Subs, if the Sub acts in such a way that would result in a Gym Leader losing their Gym, then the original leader also runs the same risk, so be cautious with who you assign as your sub.</li>
            <li>Gym Leader Subs are not guaranteed the Gym if the original Gym Leader steps down, the position will feature open trials for anyone to be able to participate in.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2><u>MEMBER RULES</u></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Try to be respectful. Banter is fine, but don’t go overboard.</li>
            <li>Don’t spam. Repeating yourself over and over again is an easy way to get kicked, and to get on people’s bad sides. Spamming soundbytes is especially obnoxious; don’t do it.</li>
            <li>Please do not advertise your own websites on The Silver League unless specifically allowed to. This is a community in and of itself, not a bulletin board for yours.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no threatening of any SL members is permitted. This is pretty self-explanatory.</li>
            <li>Using the “highpitchsqueal” soundbyte or chat-obstructing images is a no-no.</li>
            <li>Please do not impersonate others. This only complicates things and you WILL get caught.</li>
            <li>Keep your chat name reasonable. That is to say, don’t load it up with a bunch of colours and emoticons. People don’t want to see that stuff every time you type a message. It’s obnoxious.</li>
            <li>Do not ignore moderators (denoted by the white pawn) and owners (denoted by the orange pawn). Moderators are meant to keep the chatroom civil; ignoring them prevents them from doing their job and lines you up for an easy ban. Owners are the chat’s primary administrators; you need to be able to hear them so you can catch any important information they might have. If you have a problem with a moderator or owner, take it up with Silver August.</li>
            <li>Try to keep your points concise. Discussions can get pretty heated, we understand, but try not to flood the chat in the process.</li>
            <li>If you wish to run your own tournaments, please make sure to discuss it with Silver August beforehand to get permission. This is to ensure that your tourney does not conflict with any official SL events. We may even be able to give you official support!</li>
            <li>Do not use Pokemon Showdown for official SL events.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These rules may change or be updated as time goes on. Contact Silver August if you believe a rule should be changed or added.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2><u>HOUSE RULES</u></h2>
          <p>Think of these less as rules as more as “recommendations”. You won’t get punished for breaking these (usually, anyway), but it’s in bad taste to not follow them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Try not to harass Gym Leaders with battle requests. Gym Leaders are ultimately still people with their own lives, just like you. Sometimes they may not be up to battling or not have the time. Be respectful of this.</li>
            <li>When challenging Gym Leaders and the Elite Four, avoid counter-teaming. Counter-teaming is the act of bringing a team meant specifically to shut down your opponent’s team. It shows a lack of creativity and a lack of respect on your part, not to mention making you look bad.</li>
            <li>Don’t be a smug jerk. Boasting about winning is alright, but please don’t go overboard.</li>
            <li>Try to avoid forfeits and disconnections in official SL battles. On top of being disrespectful, it complicates things if we choose to post the videos on SLN.</li>
            <li>Do not ask for Showdown battles unless you have been excused by Owners for a particular reason (e.g needing to replace a broken console or an lost game).</li>
            <li>Do not mention or bring up Discord, the topic of using it is not up for discussion and any unauthorized groups are not permitted, if caught (and housing rudeness towards other SL members) everyone involved will be banned and striped of any status' they currently have.</li>
            <li>If you are BANNED for any reason related to unsportsmanlike conduct, abuse of systems or extreme rudeness, then you will be subject to a potential punishment of having ALL your current Gym Badges revoked. Repeating cases will be subject to banning from ALL Gym Battles and/or Official SL events.</li>
            <li>DO NOT come to SL just for battles, interact with the community. If you are only showing up for tournament or gym battles are are spamming Gym Leaders requesting challenges. You may find yourself BANNED from challenging them or being eligible for Tournanets till further notice.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>The Silver League uses the Xat chat client, which divides administrative power between five “groups”; Guests, Members, Moderators, Owners & the Main Owner.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Guests: Denoted by a green pawn, these are people that have just logged into The Silver League’s chatroom for the first time. They cannot talk in or see the main chat. They will usually be granted membership status soon after logging on; if you log on and don’t get membered right away, simply contact an online moderator or owner. You may also be guested as a punishment if you step out of line, so take care to follow the rules.</li>
            <li>Members: Members make up the majority of the people on The Silver League and are denoted by a blue pawn. Members are capable of speaking in the chatroom and participating in league events. You’ll be given member status when you log on for the first time.</li>
            <li>Moderators: Moderators are denoted by a white pawn. Their job is to oversee the chatroom and keep discussion civil. Moderators also work alongside Owners to ensure league business runs smoothly. Moderators are capable of kicking offending members, as well as banning them for up to six (6) hours should they prove particularly problematic.<p>NOTE: Mods, please do not unban another Mod's ban, if you have issue with it, talk it through with them in private and if an agreement cannot be found please talk to Silver August or another Owner if he is not present at the time.</p></li>
            <li>Owners: Owners are The Silver League’s primary administrators, and are denoted by the orange pawn. Owners maintain the league and its various features, and make decisions on the future of the league as well as moderator appointments and permabans. Owners can assign and revoke moderator status, kick offending members and moderators and ban them for an unlimited amount of time.</li>
            <li>Main Owner: Also denoted by an orange pawn, the Main Owner is the head administrator of The Silver League. He has complete access to the inner workings of the website and its offshoots, and has the final say on any changes to the website or its staff. The Main Owner can promote, demote, ban and kick other owners in addition to moderators and members, and makes the final call on whether to blacklist an individual from the website. League Master Silver August is the only main owner.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As well as the above, Xat uses red and brown pawns to denote offline and banned individuals, respectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2><u>BAN STATUS</u></h2>
          <p>Should you break the rules of The Silver League, you run the risk of being banned. Bans on the Silver League are broken up into three categories: Temporary Bans, Perma-Bans, and Blacklist Bans.</p>
          <p>Temporary Bans: These are exactly what they say on the tin; bans that will expire after a set period of time. These are usually for relatively minor offenses, as well as to put a cap on fighting and excessive arguments. Moderators can only perform temporary bans, and can ban for up to 6 hours. Owners can ban for as long as they feel it is appropriate. Moderators and Owners can reverse temporary bans should they feel they are no longer necessary.</p>
          <p>Perma-Bans: Perma-Bans are bans that do not have a set expiry time. Only owners can deliver perma-bans, and only owners can lift them. Perma-Bans are reserved for serious offenses, and will only be lifted should the offending person prove they’ve learned their lesson. If you’ve been perma-banned and feel it should be lifted, contact an online owner.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2><u>TOURNAMENT COMMITTEE</u></h2>
          <p>Outside of the CLT, all Tournaments are organized and authorized by a committee responsible for keeping the events going and lively within the community (while also taking some of the weight off of Silver's back). If you wish to host your own or offer an idea for a tournament, place pitch your idea to any of the committee's members.</p>
          <p>Committee Members:</p>
          <ul id="committee-members"></ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2><u>LEAGUE RANKINGS</u></h2>
          <p>The Silver League uses a letter ranking system known as the Grade Rank Achievement System to denote league progress. New members start at Rank D and can climb up the rankings by defeating gyms. Every 2 badges will result in you ranking up. Once you’ve achieved at least Rank A, you can apply to become a gym leader. Once you’ve achieved Rank S, you can join SL Champion’s League Tournaments. Rank SS is reserved for those who have defeated the Elite Four and Champion.</p>

          <h2><u>THE SILVER LEAGUE CHAMPION’S LEAGUE TOURNAMENT</u></h2>
          <p>The Silver League Champion’s League Tournament is The Silver League’s way of determining who can challenge the Elite Four and Champion. Those who have obtained at least 8 badges can register for the tournament and will battle it out against other trainers who have accomplished the same. The end reward is a chance to make a run at the title of Silver League Champion! Contact League Master Silver August (or, if he’s not available, another owner) to sign up.</p>
          <p>Champion’s League Tournaments occur once at the end of every month. Interested Trainers must sign up for a tourney before the start of Round 1, or else they must wait until next month. Each round has a time limit of 6-12 hours depending on the round. Trainers MUST complete their battles within the time limit. If one trainer fails to show up, they forfeit the round to their opponent. If BOTH trainers fail to show up, the trainer that was online last will move on, and the other trainer will forfeit.</p>
          <p>For specific details about the Champion’s League Tournament, and to find out when the next one is, head to the Elite Four page of the Silver League website.</p>
