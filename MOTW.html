    <p>Missed out on a Moveset of the Week? Well here's where you can find every MOTW that has ever been submitted, they're updated weekly every Sunday and provided by YOU the fans and members. Anyone can submit a Moveset with the potential of being featured on the site and if your's isn't picked that week, don't worry, League Master Silver August welcomes (and highly encourages) always having a new set ready to feature the following week. Getting your own set up is as simple as sending an email but there are a few minor rules to the MOTW, if only to keep things consistent and professional.</p>
    <p>Rules:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>List and follow the information set up for all other MOTWs. I.e, provide the nature, item, ability, EV spread with you submission, special set nickname is also encouraged.</li>
      <li>TRY to keep the options in the Moveset to a minimum, it makes following Rule No. 3 a little easier.</li>
      <li>Keep the Moveset write-up around 350-500 words, this is more then enough room and submissions WELL beyond this limit will not be used, however sets slightly above may pass (with some editing done to them.)</li>
      <li>Avoid spelling and grammar errors, each set is reviewed before submission but excessive mistakes makes preparing the MOTW tedious and time consuming, so sets that require a lot of editing in order to be presentable will not be submitted.</li>
      <li>Be professional, everyone will be seeing this set with your name on it, so don't embarass yourself or the site.</li>
      <li>Try to be orginal, submiting a classic set is fine once in awhile, but try to avoid just submitting a set you can find on another site like Smogon, come up with something new that actually works! And show people that certain Pokemon can be awesome if you give them a shot.</li>
      <li>Have fun!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you got a set and wish to have it on the site, then just e-mail it to League Master Silver August!</p>
