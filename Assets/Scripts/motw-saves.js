      desc: "<p>The day was July 30th, 2018. The location, SL's unofficial containment chamber, henceforth referred to as JEARS. JEARS, being full of a bunch of jaded fuckwits who hate Pokemon, has its own competitive Pokemon chatroom. Mostly, it's used to shit on competitive Pokemon. On this day however, JEARS goon Dru came up with a most ridiculous concept: Seel, with Whirlpool and Perish Song.</p><p>Pretty soon, Dru, along with fellow goon Lains and JEARS Underlord Geno, began refining this ridiculous Seel set. Once we refined it into perfection, we began creating other ridiculous sets. We turned our eyes to dumb defensive Pokemon, where we stumbled upon Mud-Slap. We started coming up with elaborate ways to abuse the move since for some reason Accuracy-reducing moves are legal. Eventually we reached Stunfisk, and Geno insisted that we give it Limber with a Cheri Berry, for the memes.</p><p>Then, Geno reached enlightenment.</p><p>He realized that one of the Pokemon with Mud-Slap, Diggersby, could also get Cheek Pouch. He then realized it could learn Recycle. He got to work, his idiocy hitting maximum overdrive, until finally he had done it.</p><p>Jaboca Berry Diggersby.</p><p>Jaboca Berry deals damage equal to 25% of an attacker's HP when the holder is with a physical attack. Using Cheek Pouch, Diggersby would heal off some of that damage. Then, using Recycle, it would get the Jaboca Berry back for round 2. Bulldoze lowered the opponent's Speed, ensuring Diggersby could get the Recycle off. Toxic and Super Fang broke down all that tried to stall Diggersby.</p><p>The idiot singularity had been reached. But, there was a problem: Because Game Freak is arbitrary and stupid, Jaboca Berry wasn't in the Gen 7 games. Stricken with grief, Geno walked out onto his balcony and considered committing die, but he persevered. Jaboca Berry Diggersby soon faded into obscurity. Dru would later get banned for subverting the regime, and normalcy would return to the land.</p><p>Until today. Fellow JEARS Underlord Cameron came from the Serebii Kingdom with a prophecy. On January 9th, 2019, the Jaboca Berry would be unleashed. On that fateful day, the the prophecy came true.</p><p>It was done. A weapon to surpass Metal JEARS would finally be unleashed.</p>",

      desc: "<p>Hey SL, Amber here with a doubles build Goodra design for you all.  The basic idea behind this Goodra is an heavy tank that can stick around and nip away with damage.  It is meant to be paired with a rain Pokemon like Pelipper for hydration to enable it to wake up from resting, and the focus sash will prevent a OHKO before it can rest, it's bulk would make Leftovers an option as well though as a OHKO would be difficult without setup.  It works wonderfully in a U-turn switch in from a Pelipper who sets rain at the start of a match, and even better if you have a trick room up to take advantage of it's lower speed with the relaxed Nature.  The move set is designed to have a stab, a move boosted by the rain, and coverage along with rest. With the EVs spread and max IVs in HP, Defense, and Special defense at level 50 this build will have 165 HP, 134 Defense, and 202 Special defense, while being at max of 90 speed for that trick room set up to have a good chance of getting rest activated before being hit if at low HP.  Thanks to Hydration as long as the rain is still up it will wake up it's next turn, and will also heal itself from any poison, paralyze, or burn while it is raining as well giving it even greater staying power.</p><p>Ideal Teammates:</p><p>Pelipper to have rain up, Mimikyu for trick room, Toxaoex for another rain boosted wall to divide attack focus. I personally find Malamar to work well with this build as well as a contrary Malamar can boost itself up with superpower, making the coverage choice on Goodra more simple and reset trick room as well in an emergency.</p><p>I know Doubles is not the most popular format here in SL, but I do hope you will enjoy giving this build a try sometime.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this set.</p><p>EDITOR NOTE: Due to the rules in place regarding MOTWs, Thunderbolt and Power Whip were not listed with the other moves, but please keep them in mind for alternative options depending on the team you're putting together.</p>",

      desc: "<p>Here I go once again with  the email, every week I hope that it’s from a female. So I was slowly running out of good meme ideas for sets, after such great hits like Ryan the godslaying Corphish and HymenBuster1 the lucky punch Chansey, I needed something to follow up on the trend of absolutely garbage Pokemon sets to dick around with. Then I hit me, back to the beautiful early days of the internet, I remember how in its genesis, Strong Bad emails and Trogdor the Burninator were born. I think to my myself what dragon type could fit the bill the best for such an incredible idea, then it hit me, the beefiest armed dragon type there is, DRUDDIGON! He has wings, spinities, beefy arms, and a spiky tail. The only problem was getting a Pokemon with only a very small amount of fire attacks to become the burninator of all. However, I was able to make it work, ladies and gentlemen, I give you, Trogdor the Druddigon!</p><p>In total, Druddigon has seven fire type attacks, only 2 of which being at all useful, the rest being just about as useful as Aqua. And in the context of Druddigon, really only fire punch makes sense. Having three attacking fire type moves, gives Druddigon a nice wide range to hit ice types, grass types, steel types, and the ever powerful bug type. Wrapping up, giving it sunny day allows Druddigon to not only boost the power of its fire type attacks to even greater levels, but it also allows it to become an effective sun-setter for others on this beasts team. Items like flame plate and charcoal give the fire attacks an even greater boost in power, possibly even knock types that take neutral damage down to ¼ health. Being such a slow boy, this</p><p> Druddigon mostly works best on a trick room team, with other slow and strong Pokemon, like Escavalier and Pokemon like a trick room setting Mimikyu for coverage. In terms of EV spreads, max special attack and HP give Druddigon the best possible special attack stat and the bulk to be able to stay on the field, giving the last little bit of EV’s to its attack to keep that stat good as well. Have fun with Pokemon with Flash Fire, or just resist fire attacks in general. This maybe one of the worst sets I have made.</p>",
