        `The day was July 30th, 2018. The location, SL's unofficial containment chamber, henceforth referred to as JEARS. JEARS, being full of a bunch of jaded fuckwits who hate Pokemon, has its own competitive Pokemon chatroom. Mostly, it's used to shit on competitive Pokemon. On this day however, JEARS goon Dru came up with a most ridiculous concept: Seel, with Whirlpool and Perish Song.`,
        `Pretty soon, Dru, along with fellow goon Lains and JEARS Underlord Geno, began refining this ridiculous Seel set. Once we refined it into perfection, we began creating other ridiculous sets. We turned our eyes to dumb defensive Pokemon, where we stumbled upon Mud-Slap. We started coming up with elaborate ways to abuse the move since for some reason Accuracy-reducing moves are legal. Eventually we reached Stunfisk, and Geno insisted that we give it Limber with a Cheri Berry, for the memes.`,
        `Then, Geno reached enlightenment.`,
        `He realized that one of the Pokemon with Mud-Slap, Diggersby, could also get Cheek Pouch. He then realized it could learn Recycle. He got to work, his idiocy hitting maximum overdrive, until finally he had done it.`,
        `Jaboca Berry Diggersby.`,
        `Jaboca Berry deals damage equal to 25% of an attacker's HP when the holder is with a physical attack. Using Cheek Pouch, Diggersby would heal off some of that damage. Then, using Recycle, it would get the Jaboca Berry back for round 2. Bulldoze lowered the opponent's Speed, ensuring Diggersby could get the Recycle off. Toxic and Super Fang broke down all that tried to stall Diggersby.`,
        `The idiot singularity had been reached. But, there was a problem: Because Game Freak is arbitrary and stupid, Jaboca Berry wasn't in the Gen 7 games. Stricken with grief, Geno walked out onto his balcony and considered committing die, but he persevered. Jaboca Berry Diggersby soon faded into obscurity. Dru would later get banned for subverting the regime, and normalcy would return to the land.`,
        `Until today. Fellow JEARS Underlord Cameron came from the Serebii Kingdom with a prophecy. On January 9th, 2019, the Jaboca Berry would be unleashed. On that fateful day, the the prophecy came true.`,
        `It was done. A weapon to surpass Metal JEARS would finally be unleashed.`

        "Hey SL, Amber here with a doubles build Goodra design for you all. The basic idea behind this Goodra is an heavy tank that can stick around and nip away with damage. It is meant to be paired with a rain Pokemon like Pelipper for hydration to enable it to wake up from resting, and the focus sash will prevent a OHKO before it can rest, it's bulk would make Leftovers an option as well though as a OHKO would be difficult without setup. It works wonderfully in a U-turn switch in from a Pelipper who sets rain at the start of a match, and even better if you have a trick room up to take advantage of it's lower speed with the relaxed Nature. The move set is designed to have a stab, a move boosted by the rain, and coverage along with rest. With the EVs spread and max IVs in HP, Defense, and Special defense at level 50 this build will have 165 HP, 134 Defense, and 202 Special defense, while being at max of 90 speed for that trick room set up to have a good chance of getting rest activated before being hit if at low HP.  Thanks to Hydration as long as the rain is still up it will wake up it's next turn, and will also heal itself from any poison, paralyze, or burn while it is raining as well giving it even greater staying power.",
        "Ideal Teammates:",
        "Pelipper to have rain up, Mimikyu for trick room, Toxapex for another rain boosted wall to divide attack focus. I personally find Malamar to work well with this build as well as a contrary Malamar can boost itself up with superpower, making the coverage choice on Goodra more simple and reset trick room as well in an emergency.</p><p>I know Doubles is not the most popular format here in SL, but I do hope you will enjoy giving this build a try sometime.",

        "Here I go once again with the email, every week I hope that it’s from a female. So I was slowly running out of good meme ideas for sets, after such great hits like Ryan the godslaying Corphish and HymenBuster1 the lucky punch Chansey, I needed something to follow up on the trend of absolutely garbage Pokemon sets to dick around with. Then I hit me, back to the beautiful early days of the internet, I remember how in its genesis, Strong Bad emails and Trogdor the Burninator were born. I think to my myself what dragon type could fit the bill the best for such an incredible idea, then it hit me, the beefiest armed dragon type there is, DRUDDIGON! He has wings, spinities, beefy arms, and a spiky tail. The only problem was getting a Pokemon with only a very small amount of fire attacks to become the burninator of all. However, I was able to make it work, ladies and gentlemen, I give you, Trogdor the Druddigon!",
        "In total, Druddigon has seven fire type attacks, only 2 of which being at all useful, the rest being just about as useful as Aqua. And in the context of Druddigon, really only fire punch makes sense. Having three attacking fire type moves, gives Druddigon a nice wide range to hit ice types, grass types, steel types, and the ever powerful bug type. Wrapping up, giving it sunny day allows Druddigon to not only boost the power of its fire type attacks to even greater levels, but it also allows it to become an effective sun-setter for others on this beasts team. Items like flame plate and charcoal give the fire attacks an even greater boost in power, possibly even knock types that take neutral damage down to ¼ health. Being such a slow boy, this",
        "Druddigon mostly works best on a trick room team, with other slow and strong Pokemon, like Escavalier and Pokemon like a trick room setting Mimikyu for coverage. In terms of EV spreads, max special attack and HP give Druddigon the best possible special attack stat and the bulk to be able to stay on the field, giving the last little bit of EV’s to its attack to keep that stat good as well. Have fun with Pokemon with Flash Fire, or just resist fire attacks in general. This maybe one of the worst sets I have made."],

Vileplume is often overlooked as a defensive grass type because of the sheer bulk and access to regenerator of the Pokémon that are Tangrowth and Amoongus, however Vileplume has access to something they don't! The wonderful move that is Strength sap! Strength sap allows Vileplume to reduce the attack stat of any physical attacker that makes contact with it while also healing HP.",
        "Now on to what makes this set tick. First of all a bold nature with full investment in defense and 248 IVs in HP gives Vileplume the bulk it needs to act as a defensive pivot. Effect spore is the ability of choice since the 30% chance of status on contact can cripple one of our opponents threats and black sludge paired with giga drain and strength sap gives Vileplume the recovery it needs to stay healthy as long as possible. The leftover IVs are put into special attack just to give a boost to Vileplume's stab attacks.",
        "Strength sap is the key move of this set. A recovery move that isn't affected by an opponent's unfavorable weather condition is huge for a Pokémon that used to have to rely on moonlight, plus the attack drop can be enough to force a switch out. Sludge bomb is the main STAB option for Vileplume as it does decent damage and has a chance to poison. Giga drain is our secondary stab and completes the recovery package. Lastly sleep powder is used a utility option against switch ins that would normally wall Vileplume or try to use it as setup fodder and it lets us potentially get a free turn to swap to a setup sweeper of our own.",
        "Specially bulky water types for a nice defensive core with Vileplume as they cover the weakness to fire and ice and many of them can provide hazard removal for the team with either rapid spin or defog. Heatran is a great partner for Vileplume as they cover each others resistances nicely and Heatran can deal with the steel types that wall this particular Vileplume build.",
        "Vileplume can also function decently as a sun sweeper. access to chlorophyll and a respectable 110 base special attack stat paired with a modest nature and growth can make it a decent threat on sun teams.",
        "In closing a would like to make a very special Thank You to Shiinotic. For letting Vileplume use its signature move and just being a fun guy in general. Thanks for reading, Abel"

        "Alolan-Marowak is an interesting pokemon. It's typing is very helpful against common offensive pokemon, and its variety of attacks are threatening to many defensive cores. While its stats may look unappealing at first, it can become a defensive and offensive powerhouse capable of checking and countering a large selection of pokemon found in the metagame.",
        "For our set, we will focus on Marowak's unique ability to abuse its EV's and Lightning Rod in a way no other pokemon in the game can. Thanks to thick club, Marowak is capable of reaching attack output on par with power houses such as Darmanitan and Mega Charizard with little EV investment. While speed is an important stat, Marowak won't outspeed much regardless. So, we will be taking its impressive typing and put into its bulk. Max HP gives Marowak the most bulk possible, and gives it an odd HP number to help combat its stealth rock weakness. 208 SpD EV's will allow Marowak impressive tanking ability, allowing it to survive one earth power from Heatran, and even survive Psyshock/Psychic from Scarf Tapu Lele after stealth rock. With an immunity to Electric from its ability, Marowak is capable of remaining untouched by many electric types you will see, such as Tapu Koko, and Zapdos, both of which will never be able to touch Marowak. Non-choice band Tapu Bulu will struggle to KO Marowak aswell. What's left is put into attack, giving Marowak higher attack than a Mega Charizard-X.",
        "Our moves are made for punishing common cores, and to lure certain pokemon which would otherwise deal with any normal Marowak set. Flare-Blitz is our most powerful fire option, capable of 2HKO'ing offensive Landorus variants. Frail pokemon that resist fire will be unable to safely come into play, such as Greninja. Shadow Bone is great stab, and can punish pokemon that don't resist our other attacks, has relatively no consequences, and is great when you have hard choices to make with your other coverage. Bonemerang can bypass Sturdy, and focus sash while also being unhindered by Grassy Terrain's effects, making it better than Earthquake allowing Marowak to be placed on teams with Tapu Bulu, and fight against common Bulu cores featuring Toxapex, and Heatran. With Flare Blitz, this can defeat the dreaded Toxapex Heatran Celesteela core, and combat standard Stall teams using Skarmory, Toxapex, and Mega Sableye. Stealth rock is a good choice, as Marowak pressures many pokemon allowing free rocks, while also being immune to Rapid Spin. Thunder Punch allows Marowak to combat bulky water types such as Tapu Fini as it reliably 2hko's, and also can be used to combat Hawlucha. In electric terrain, Marowak can potentially 1hko Hawlucha with Thunder Punch after it has its defense buff. Be wary however, if Hawlucha has a swords dance, it will KO Marowak. Worth mentioning, Toxic and Will-o-wisp are great all round choices. Some things just can't be hurt with these 3 moves, but can with Toxic and Will-O-Wisp.",
        "Be wary when using Marowak. Hazards pressure Marowak, and it's prone to Pursuit users. Above all else, always be mindful of losing your item. Scout for knock off users. I'd recommend pairing with Tapu Bulu to negate Earthquake and water weakness. Z move users/mega's resisting dark are also nice, as Marowak will have no issues retreating into it."

Two the other two abilities do nothing here. Lucky for Venonat it can evolve so it gets the nice item in Evolite which gives it 50% buff to both defs. Ev speard is my basic speard for curse sets.

Curse is the play here free Att and Def, which one makes it harder to kill and that att helps with Leech Life which does more damage and more healing.

Now this does need mons to help deal with Zards Heatran Skarm etc aka anything that can hit like a train or something that holds down venonat/phase it out, things like rotom-w help here, garchomp can help too but there's a good number of mons that can hinder this set so it does need the help lol."

I have been using Chimecho as a staple on my teams since early generation 6 and it hasn’t let me down yet. Now, it does take some setup to work, but when it gets a few cosmic powers up, it becomes nearly unkillable. I was battling a Machamp that came in to deal with my Chimecho after it had a chance to get a pair of Cosmic Powers off, and it shrugged off a knock off from a guts burned Machamp, which there is little that’ll have a more powerful Knock Off without setup. After that, I proceeded to take out most of my opponent’s team with a Stored Power sweep.",

Having a fighting type pokemon on the team or a hard hitting pokemon with fighting type coverage will go a long way in supporting Chimecho. Luckily, fighting coverage is fairly easy to come by.",

When this happens, you can use either Heal Bell to support the rest of the team or use Healing Wish, a move very few pokemon have access to, and fewer still that would have room to fit it into their move sets, to fully restore another member of your team.",

This set may seem on the off side, but it is purely meant to take advantage of all the quad weaknesses some of the big OU boys have. With its natural bulk and high attack stat this thing will live nearly every hit on the block and even the ones it doesn’t have a 100% chance of living, there is a chance if you set up one curse and then you can take out a big threat with one solid punch. Garchomp? Boom ice punch and gone. Scizor? Bam, fire punch gone. Z bounce gyrados? Bang thunder punch gone. The best part about it is even mons that don’t have quad weaknesses, it can still do a giant chunk to them. Added in the chance for any of the four effects depending on what you hit and you can tilt everyone right off the battlefield with the power of RNG.",
        "Alolan Muk has its downsides like its very low speed tier, but it is more then made up for with its dark typing giving it a psychic immunity and only one weakness in that of ground. The best part about the set is that your opponent will never see the moves coming. Most Muks go for STAB poison and dark moves and a priority shadow sneak with only one elemental punch for some coverage or curse set up. This means that if your opponent sees one punch they won’t expect the other. “Oh he fire punched my Scizor? Guess that means I’m free to go to Gyrados.” WRONG! Zap that lizard and send it back to the ball leaving the opponent shaking their head both in utter confusion why anyone would run a double punch set and that they actually lost to it.",
        "The EVs are pretty self-explanatory on this set. Max attack for maximum damage and Max HP to have as much bulk as possible. The final 4 go into defense because most of the treats nowadays tend to be on the physical side and any special ones can’t normally OHKO Muk thanks to its natural base 100 Sp.def. These give you the best odds of surviving any hit before dishing back a good ole quad effective hit right to them and erasing a big threat from your team. Add in a very good wish passer and you can even get more then one mon down if they are",
        "packing more then one quad weakness like a lando Scizor combo. Just send him right up to full and let the fists fly!",

Firstly the main gimmick here is belly drum which will be boosting Walrein's awful 80 attack to the max. Since Walrein is also pitifully slow at base 65 we'll want to give it some kind of speed boost. The only opportunity Walrein has to boost its speed is via the +1 boost that Z-rain dance gives.",

The second attacking move is more problematic as Walrein's coverage is very poor and it can only hit certain things depending on the moves it selects. With Ice fang it can hit grass types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu for high damage. With earthquake it can hit Toxapex and with Return it can hit Rotom-wash for high damage. It is also worth noting that for a choice of ability Thick fat or Oblivious can be used depending on your preference.",

Spikes might seem very strange for a lot of newer people in the competitive scene, but following the basedlords words, ash-greninja forces out a lot of pokemon and puts a lot of pressure onto teams beating out U-turn in this spot because the overall utility ash-gren can manage to get by putting up spikes is a lot better than the occasional momentum that u-turn will give you due the very reliable chip damage taken by spikes which can also put a lot of Pokémon in range of Ash-gren's- or it's teammates attacks. Hydro Pump should probably always be used over Surf on Greninja, the damage output of surf can not even compare to this move's, Hydro Pump gets ash-greninja a lot of KOs which it needs to even activate Battle Bond it's very easy to say you either miss the move or miss the kill with this comparison, Hydro pump mows through a lot of common walls with neutral damage and simply outclasses surf. Last but not least there is the multiple hit priority move Water Shuriken. Water Shuriken can actually sweep teams in the late game if ash-gren is played well, The move's chance to hit five times and literally outspeed even more things that ash-gren didn't before makes sure that there is a lot of offensive pressure on the opponent. There is a lot more to say about it's moves but this is the simplest way to put it.",
        "Now onto the Ev spread, Ash-Gren has a very regular sEv spread for a sweeper, maximum special attack to maximize damage output done to the opponent and maximum speed in this case to speed tie with Modest mega alakazam and outspeed tapu koko when transformed. With these EVs ash-greninja remains to be a top tier OU threat and will be for the rest of gen 7.",
        "This was just a simple explanation of the regular ash-greninja set, mainly to ntroduce newer people to the scene, I hope you enjoyed it."

        "Let’s start off with Z-heal block, using your Z-move on heal block will give latios +2 in special attack and still disable every recovery move that the opponent has, this allows it to both set up on a lot of stall pokemon and cancel them from stalling out your latios. Psyshock can be used as an emergency z-move in late game but it’s main use is to take care of specially defensive walls in stall such as chansey and Toxapex which take a lot of damage from it after heal block and  can’t stall out latios. Roost serves to give Latios longevity throughout it’s stalbreaking, while most stall teams don’t do a lot of damage, they are able to chip Latios but Roost allows Latios to heal this off. Ice beam gives Latios great coverage against opposing Dragon types but also defeating common OU pokemon such as Landorus- and Tornadus-therian.",
        "The EV spread is a simple 252/252, the special attack allows Latios to hit as hard as possible so it can break through stall and other teams. The speed put into Latios allows it to speed tie with base 110 Pokemon but also outspeed Major threats like Kartana and Blacephalon. Latios is able to kill both with ice beam or psyshock depending on the Pokemon due to their lacking defensive stats. If you do not care for speed or want to know the exact Power of kills with latios you can always opt for a more bulky spread but taking out EVs out of either one of these sets so Latios can get a bit more durability and set up more comfortably.",
        "For this set I will suggest a Bulky Offensive team, Latios has a great typing and a good natural Bulk which allows it to be a good pivot in bulky offense teams and also allow it to set up easily if the team structure supports this.",

      "Wishiwashi is a weak Pokemon on it’s own with some of the weakest stats in the game but it makes up for it by asking for help from it’s friends forming the powerful school form to make things easier on itself. School form is a monster with it’s attack stats and defense stats over 100 but kept in check by abysmal speed and HP. it’s moveset is shallow but it can make do. Scald and surf are you water STABs; scald for the burn chance and surf for damage. Ice beam is always welcome for hitting grass, flying and dragon types. Aqua ring restore hp every turn which helps maintain schooling. The final move protect allows Wishiwashi 1 turn of no damage to restore hp. The EVs are designed to grant a decent special attack along with as much bulk as possible while being evenly distributed. Special attack is your primary attacking stat with this set and wishi’s speed is too small for any investment to matter so those stats don’t get any EVs. The item leftovers grants it hp recovery at the end of each turn to ensure it’s ability works.",
      "This Set’s primary weakness is Wishiwashi’s elemental weaknesses. Any attack that can one shot wishi or at the very least lower it’s hp too drastically for it’s recovery to keep up will shut Wishiwashi down for the rest of the match. For this reason support such as aurora veil, or grassy terrain to help wishi recover hp is very welcome to them. A wish user could alternatively use wish to help a Wishiwashi switch in by recovering it’s hp so it remains in school form if it’s hit with a move. Wishiwashi needs to be able to tank hits and hit back hard so withdraw when things get too risky or your fish will be turned into fish sticks.",

      "Hiya Silver League, Major Largo coming at you with what is quite honestly a weird set that I’m sure raises many questions. Wayofalex and I collaberated to make the set you're going to see here, so props to him for helping me make and refine this set. Anyways, given Stakataka's stat spread you would think it'd make for a good wall, right? Well screw that noise, throwing walls at each other to see which one collapses first is more fun. My own mascot may or may not also have something to do with the set we're about to cover.",
      "So since Stakataka is so slow, it’s not outspeeding anything unless it has Trick Room up, which conveniently enough it learns. With Stakataka being so dang slow, Gyro Ball is the obvious Steel-STAB of choice, hitting most everything incredibly hard thanks to Stakataka’s low speed. Stone Edge is the preferred secondary STAB of choice, hitting everything really hard provided it connects. Finally, Earthquake rounds out our moves with some truly fearsome power and coverage.",
      "Now, what I’m sure has raised the most questions: the EV and IV spreads. There’s a lot going on here, so I’ll explain as best I can. A lonely nature seems counter-intuitive at first, but it’s necessary for enabling Stakataka to sweep easier. Without a Defense-lowering nature and 17 Defense IVs, Beast Boost will always boost Defense, but with a Lonely nature, 17 Defense IVs, and maximum Attack investment, we can manipulate Beast Boost to increase our Attack instead of Defense, enabling Stakataka to sweep easier under Trick Room. The remaining EVs are put into Health, since even though we’re lowering our bulk we actually want as much as we can get away with.",
      "For our choice of item, you can go one of two ways. Rockium Z is the preferred item, denting most Pokemon pretty hard to help get a sweep going, or if you're feeling bold you can go Weakness Policy to potentially double your attack in one go, though the Policy is unreliable as two of its three weaknesses are double weaknesses. Psychium Z is also an option that removes the luck element associated with Stone Edge by giving you additional Accuracy when using Trick Room.",
      "One must be careful when using Stakataka. While its typing provides a gargantuan 8 resistances and an immunity, this same typing gives it 3 very crippling weaknesses. Use Stakataka’s bulk and resistances to",
      "Switch in on some setup fodder, then take advantage of the opportunity to set up a Trick Room. Contrary to what its stats suggest, be aggressive with Stakataka.",
      "Since Stakataka can both set up and sweep with Trick Room, teammates who can’t set it up themselves will appreciate Stakataka, plus it also relieves pressure from any other Trick Room setters you may be running."

      "Hey mates, it's Time Kitsune, your friendly neighborhood Water Gym Leader. Our focus today will be on Butterfree, the little butterfly from our early childhood. And before you ask, yes, I did catch him in a Master Ball.",
      "Butterfree is... not a great Pokémon, but he has sentimental value damn it. He also has the best set up move in the game that isn't a Z move, so you don’t have to waste your item slot. The key to using this set is slightly dependent on prediction and surprising your opponents with the simple fact that almost no one is insane enough to use a Butterfree. As is clearly evident, Butterfree is a special sweeper, aided in spades by Quiver Dance boosting its Special Attack, Speed, and less importantly its Special Defense. And thanks to the combination of Sleep Powder and Compound Eyes, Butterfree gets a guaranteed turn of sleep, allowing it to set up. However, you can take this a step further with Grassium Z and boost your Speed by one stage at the same time as you put your opponent to sleep, and trust me, with base 70 speed you are going to need as much set up as possible. Focus Sash is there to guarantee you a turn on the field, unless you aren't running hazard support, in which case you may have bigger problems. And Life Orb is there to give you a much-needed boost to your base 90 Special Attack.",
      "Now, we move on to the many, many, many weaknesses of Butterfree: Steel Types, Rock Types, Sub-Par stats, Special tanks/walls, any mon with priority, hazards, multi-hit moves, Taunt users, and every weakness under the sun. Most Steel and Rock type Pokémon can resist Butterfree's STAB moves and in turn OHKO the winged monster after breaking the sash. Pokemon with special bulk/priority/Prankster will give Butterfree a really hard time, forcing it to switch out most of the time, lest it be killed or neutered. And then there are the plethora of type disadvantages. So, in summation, just be careful when you use Butterfree, he's a fragile, yet strong Pokémon in his own right.",
      "Oh yeah, and Dio, I named him after you. He was just a wee Caterpie, and you said to kill him. 97 levels later, and he's back to say hi!"

The fire dragon is known for its immense power thanks to the harsh sunlight it brings with its Drought Ability, but this set goes a different way that Charizard Y normally goes.",
      "Yes, I know, Charizard X is the Mega Evolution that uses Dragon Dance. However, this Charizard set is one I came up with one night while trying to think of new ways to use Charizard. I've always liked Dragon Dance Charizard Y, but always thought it was missing something (that being a solid third move for its physical side). Because of this, I started to think of ways for it to hit Water- and Ground-type walls, as Thunder Punch only goes so far. My solution was a mixed set that uses its Drought to fire off a handy Solar Beam.",
      "Hasty nature and 252 Speed EVs are a must in order for this Charizard to work properly. Hasty, while decreasing your Defense, increases your Speed and doesn't hinder your ability to use both physical and special attacks, and at 100 base Speed, you need all of the help you can get. 188 Attack EVs let you 2HKO max HP Tyranitar 100% of the time with EQ (unless it has Leftovers) and OHKO specially defensive Heatran around 30% of the time. It also adds a bit of damage to Charizard's Flare Blitz's power. 68 Special Attack were the leftover EVs and are there to bump up Solar Beam a bit.",
      "Dragon Dance is Charizard's choice boosting move, allowing it to raise both its Attack and Speed stats by one stage. This pairs nicely with Charizard's Flare Blitz, a strong STAB move boosted further by the harsh sunlight of Drought, and Earthquake, an overall great coverage move. Solar Beam, while not being boosted by Dragon Dance, allows Charizard to obliterate Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Swampert, while giving it a way to hit Tapu Fini and other Water-type pests. Thunder Punch could do the latter and get boosted by Dragon Dance, but it then leaves Charizard vulnerable to Pokémon like Gastrodon, who are immune to Electric-type attacks.",
      "Good Pokémon to pair this Charizard with include fast allies able to remove faster Electric-type foes to allow Charizard to set up without fear of being shocked out of the sky. Ironically, this Charizard appreciates a teammate that can take out Ferrothorn, as Flare Blitz paired with Ferrothorn's ability to dish out heavy contact recoil drop this Pokémon's HP a lot. Of course, being 4x weak to Rock-type moves, Charizard NEEDS hazard removal. Pokémon like Scizor, Tapu Fini, etc. can use Defog (or Starmie, Tentacruel, etc. Rapid Spin) to remove Stealth Rock from your side of the field to give Charizard a much easier time switching in. Lastly, this Charizard is especially weak to priority with the lessened Defense stat, so it appreciates having opponent Pokémon with priority moves taken care of before setting up.",
      "As a note, this Charizard is able to trick the opponent into thinking it's the X variant. If you Dragon Dance before Mega Evolving, the opponent will likely think you're Mega Charizard X and send in something like Landorus. You can use this to get another Dragon Dance when it Earthquakes or U-turns or to fire off a sun-boosted Flare Blitz, which, even at neutral Attack after Intimidate, still dishes out a punch. Likewise, if your opponent knows that you are Mega Charizard Y and sends out Heatran or Tyranitar, they're in for a surprise when an Earthquake rumbles beneath their feet.",

This set mainly focusses on being an Anti Lead vs HO mons, like web setters, Excadrill, et cetera. For further mention, Thundurus-Incarnate has many more sets it could abuse, so we had a difficult time choosing what set we wanted to use, but we thought this one looked fun to do a MOTW about. But without any further ado, lets get into the set;",
      "Like previously mentioned, this set is mainly used as an anti lead vs HO mons, but it also can be used as a normal defogger, and can even act as a stallbreaker. Thunderbolt / Volt Switch is Thundurus' main stab hard hitting move. It deals with water types, flying types et cetera. Superpower is there to OHKO Excadrill, Smeargle and deal immense damage vs Chansey. Knock Off is another option if you want to have more of a stall breaker core with the next two moves and helps in a lot of ways. Defog is self explanatory, get rid of those webs, rocks, or whatever, and force the Pokémon in front of you out. Taunt is there so any Pokémon that outspeeds Thundurus and wants to get up hazards, spore, et cetera, will get shutdown thanks to Prankster. HP Ice can be also used over Defog to get rid of any Landorus', Gliscors, Zygardes, et cetera. The HP Evs are there to live some hits, like Liquidation from a Araquanid so it can 2hko back with its speed. Speed is to out speed any threats and give you a fast Volt Switcher, and the rest in SpAtk because why not. The item is Focus Sash so you live some hits like an Excadrill Rock Slide so you can Superpower it back, while also helping you vs Lead Greninja.",
      "For team options we'd recommend Pokémon that don't like hazards being on the field, like M-Pinsir and Talonflame. Stealth Rockers / hazard setters would help this aswell because they'd help for example Pinsir to get certain OHKOs instead of 2hkos. We'd also recommend some defensive pivots / walls if you don't run HO yourself, and any Pokémon that can use U-turn or also Volt Switch if you want to run that Voltturn core, if you decide to use Volt Switch of course. Because of the Voltturn you could also use hard hitting mons like M-Medicham Nidoking et cetera to get them in safely without getting worn down and / or getting -1 speed because of webs.",

I first saw the design, and i hated it, but it grew on me. I fell in love with togedemaru when it was on my vgc team, but there was one thing it was missing that stopped me using it in a singles team. Its movepool is shallow. However this was fixed when USUM came out. Move tutors changed a lot of pokemon, and it changed the way I look at togedemaru.",
      "Now to talk about the moves it gets. Zing Zap is togedemaru signature move, and i would say its most useful. Zing Zap is a physical electric move (which takes advantage of togedemaru’s highest stat) with 80 base power. It has the added bonus (similar to iron head) of having a 30% chance to flinch the opponent if togedemaru moves first. Talking about iron head, togedemaru gains iron head from the move tutors. The access to iron head gives togedemaru the possibility to take on pokemon it couldn’t back in SM, with the added stab. Togedemaru also gained a third physical move with the possibility of flinching from the move tutors in USUM, Zen Headbut. Zen Headbut allows to take on fighting types (and some poison types) a lot easier, and possibly not being threatened out by their presence. The fourth move I give togedemaru is U-Turn, which allows togedemaru to get out of there when threatened.",
      "Togedemaru’s two highest stats are Attack and speed, at 98 and 96 respectively. I ocf wanted to take advantage of these stats. Yes togedemaru isn’t rapid, but it is fast enough when jolly with full investment, outspeeding quite a bit, and will outspeed most if you there are webs on their side of the field. Then i max out the attack stat so togedemaru will hit harder. But even so, its attack isn’t too high. Due it having 4 defensive moves it can use now, it can be choiced, and what's better than a band for this set. The addition of the choice band raises togedemaru’s attack to 225. Togedemaru will be able to two shot Toxapex, and even 2 shot Magearna. With the reasonable chance to to flinch, on a lucky day you’ll be able to knock out these pokemon without taking damage.",
      "There are 2 useful abilities for this togedemaru. The first simple ability is lightningrod, giving your team an immunity to electric attacks (which i extremely useful for me since you barely see me not using a mantine). The other ability, which is prefered by me, is sturdy. Sturdy is togedemaru’s hidden ability and could allow togedemaru to sponge a hit and hit again, against an unsuspecting foe. If you want an HA togedemaru, just pm me.",

With a track record of OHKO-ing a Landorus-Therian an Entei and knocking out a shiny mega gyarados, this set is insanely funny when it comes to fruition and can be a true blast to have hit kill at least one mon, especially if it is very powerful or hard to take down, leading to some pretty funny results.",
      "I suggest max attack and HP EVs since you want this little terror to live as many hits as it can to keep dishing out major attacks.

The nature easily should be adamant so that you get the maximum amount of power you can on this thing. The first attack you want is swords dance, since it provides the greatest attack boost to Corphish instead of Dragon Dance. Next, you get Knock Off just as coverage and to be a handy way to get rid of your opponent's item. After that, you want Crabhammer there to be Corphish’s main attacking move, with a huge base power of 100 and STAB, it is a serious threat to anything taking it as a neutral or super effective hit. Finally, wrapping up this monstrosity is Aqua Jet, to be Corphish’s best form of priority, since it gets a nice stab boost off of it.",

Speaking of which, Hidden Power Fire is your third move, allowing you to heavily damage the likes of Ferrothorn and other Scizor. For the last slot, either U-turn or Vacuum Wave are usable, the former allowing you to escape situations unfavorable to Scizor and the latter providing priority, should it be necessary. Other unlisted and less-advised options for this slot include Ominous Wind and Air Slash.",
      "Of course, a specially offensive Scizor requires quite a bit of support, with one of the most important being hazards. Due to your low damage output, extra chip damage is always welcome. Even one layer of Spikes can make certain attacks immensely more likely to grant you 2HKOs. Others include the obvious necessity of something to deal with opposing Fire-type Pokémon, as Scizor is both weak to them and cannot deal reliable damage to them. Pokémon like Heatran and Excadrill provide this just fine. The last major pointer for this Scizor would be that most Pokémon with even mediocre defensive stats will take a hit or two from Scizor; Pokémon such as Kyurem-Black, Tapu Lele, and other strong offensive Pokémon will allow this Scizor to more reliably pick up KOs, especially those capable of weakening specially defensive walls and tanks.",
      "Well, that's it for this MOTW. I hope you all have fun with this beast of a Pokémon!"

The difference here is this tank has the ability to hit incredibly hard with the proper set up, and the aid of the move tutors.  It is one of my personal favorite builds and on most of my teams.  Using a super Sized Gourgeist is a key to this build due to it's higher base HP and base defense at a cost of lower base speed over the other sizes.  For the nature as a physical tank that does not rely on special attacks Impish fits wonderfully.  For the ability Gourgeist does not have a great selection so any it has will do mine just happens to have frisk.",
      "For the moves we start with the basics in leech seed to help restore more HP in combination with the held leftovers keeping it up and going a long time as a good tank should be able to do.  Next we have Phantom force, the disappearing for a turn gives an extra turn of healing from leftovers or both leftovers and leech seed should you take a super effective or critical hit and need the extra healing and is a STAB for a bonus even though your attack is low.",
      "The real damage ability comes in however in the other two moves in the build.    Trick or Treat is a key and a highly over looked move as most do not see the value of adding ghost typing to the opponent pokemon, however in combination with foul play it can be extremely effective.  Trick or Treat unlike most ghost moves can even effect normal pokemon and by adding the ghost type to the target it then makes Foul Play super effective on the target.",

Celebi is one of the mythical Pokémon with 100 in all its stats giving it great versatility in battle, however the set I decided to run was, surprising, a physical wall.",
      "Now many people gave my very strange looks when I tell them that I use a stall Celebi and I can see where they are coming from. Grass / Psychic isn’t the best type defensively being weak to 7 types including that horrifying x4 weakness to bug making it weak to one of the most prevalent physical attackers in the game being Mega-Scizor, however these people fail to see that Celebi also counters some of the most physical types in the game like fighting and ground. Anyway, let’s get into how to actually use this thing.",
      "To start with you need to get it onto the field which is as simple as predicting a physical attack from something that it isn’t weak to like Scizor or any water move as Celebi can easily eat those up. Once it has entered the battle you want to toxic your opponent and then leech seed them. If at any point you feel like you’re within kill range use recover. With recover + leech seed + leftovers you should be gaining back HP rapidly. Once that has been completed start attacking with your move of",
      "choice. I personally use Psychic as it helps deal with fighting types, something my team has a problem with, but Giga Drain works equally as well and helps with the recovery aspect of Celebi.

Also don’t be afraid to take risks, as I have seen time and time again, this thing can take a lot of strong super effective physical attacks and live, such as Poison Jab for example.",

Earthquake is Swampert’s best physical STAB move, as it allows you to hit pokémon such as Tapu Koko super effectively, allowing you to OHKO it.

The 68 attack EVs are there so you can OHKO Tapu Koko and so you can KO Mega Charizard X after Stealth Rock damage, and it also allows you to 2HKO Assault Vest Magearna. The defensive investment allows you to live 2 Dragon Claws from a Mega Charizard X and to live 3 Bug Bites from Mega Scizor.

The leftover EVs are put in Special Attack to optimize the EV Spread (because Spear scares me).",

      "Hello Silver League, Spark (iDeltaSpark) here with MY FIRST and hopeful moveset of the week featuring an unorthodox idea to say the least, but isn't that what moveset of the week is for? Anyhow, this is exactly what it looks like, a Weak Armor sweeping Skarmory. Most of the time, Skarmory plays a very defensive role on a team, you know, setting rocks, spikes, defogging. Well, NOT with this set. This set focuses on Skarmorys' less known side, it's attacking side, with a base attack of 80 it can actually hit pretty hard naturally, and on top of that it has a spectacular base defense of 140, allowing it to take hits from physical attackers, albeit not as well as it's normal set.",
      "Now, onward to the moves. Swords Dance is to boost that 80 base attack stat to something much higher, without Swords Dance, this set would honestly be pretty pointless because Skarmory NEEDS that attack buff to really get itself going. Once you've got your Swords Dance up though and a speed boost from Weak Armor, it's time to get moving. With Skarmorys' increased speed, it allows you to outrun a lot of things that Skarmory otherwise could not outrun and hit shockingly hard with its STAB moves, Drill Peck/Brave Bird or Iron Head. A note though, if you're going to use Brave Bird, be very careful as this set has no means of recovery on it whatsoever. Guard Swap is there just in case you know you will not be able to OHKO or 2HKO your opponent and you want to instead cripple them by transferring your dropped defense from Weak Armor to them to soften them up or force a switch. Alternatively you can run Rock Slide to hit one of Skarmorys' big weaknesses: Fire types.",
      "There are multiple ways to run this same set however, you don't HAVE to use a Kee Berry, you can use a plethora of different things, Life Orb, Starf Berry, Weakness Policy, the list goes on and on. But one thing is for certain no matter what you use, your opponent will NOT expect to be swept by a Skarmory of all Pokemon. However, you have a couple of things to watch out for. Obviously Electric types and very hard hitting physical pokemon that can outspeed even after a Weak Armor boost will be an immediate problem, pokemon that can resist your STAB moves and pokemon that usually carry HP Fire will be problematic as well. Even Priority can be a problem if you find yourself being hit down to a low amount of HP. This is a set where you have to chose your battles carefully, and by doing so you will be rewarded. It works especially well when you have the element of surprise.",
      "Anyhow, i think that's all for me. I do hope you all enjoy this unorthodox set. Until next time."

      "Earthquake is the bane of Toxapex, as it does a minimum of 47.5% on standard Toxapex, with a 2HKO guaranteed with Stealth Rocks up. Toxic is the move to throw on as many Pokémon you can, and if your opponent lacks status healing, it’s deadly. Lastly, Seismitoad makes for a great Stealth Rock user, as it can scare off Landorus with Scald, Zapdos, Mantine, and Latios with Toxic, and more. This gives it a unique position where it pressures the opponent from getting their Stealth Rocks up early, while also stacking hazards and status to punish your opponent for being too cautious with their Pokémon.",
      "As for the EVs, 200 HP EVs gives Seismitoad enough HP to make Seismic Toss a 5HKO. 68 Speed is to speed-creep Specially Defensive Heatran by a single point of speed to KO with Earthquake. 136 Defense on an Impish nature makes an Earthquake from Landorus-T a 3HKO at best, versus Seismitoad’s 49.2% 2HKO with Scald. On Choiced Landorus, Seismitoad again wins with a 2HKO with Scald. The remaining EVs are dumped into Seismitoad’s Special Defense stat to help it sponge Special attacks.",

Heatran complements Seismitoad perfectly, allowing it to not run Stealth Rock and instead carry another move to help take on its threats, while gaining a partner to soak up water moves and scare away both Landorus and Toxapex. Mega Venusaur is nice too, as it walls Kartana with Hidden Power Fire. Lastly, a status support user is nice to keep Toxic or Sleep off of the Toad so he can keep doing his job.",

This Gengar has a beautiful duo stab set of Curse and Toxic, meaning no matter what gets trappeds in, its going to be taking some damage. Curse does vastly more damage per turn, at the cost of half your Health, which is why Black Sludge is important. Protect lets you live longer, getting that lovely second turn of healing, and preventing them from hurting you as curse rips more of their health away. Toxic is for if you cant hurt them with curse due you your HP being too low and protect on cool down, or if you want even more damage per turn.",
      "The EV's are there to allow you to get the Mean Look and Curse up early, before they can hit you that much. Also to let you live more, as Gengar loves to live longer, paradoxically. The nature is such that you get the sense this is a happy, teasing ghost, just wanting to have fun, while at the same time, also helping the goals set by the EV's, so that's a nice bonus.",
      "For team mates, this mischievous ghost wants a wish passer. Extra healing is a great boost, and no one does wish passing for Gengar better, then Umbreon. Umbreon is an amazing pick for helping, as it can take the Psychic, Ghost, and Dark hits that Gengar wants to avoid, and Gengar walls any Bug or Fighting aimed at Umbreon.",
      "Many thanks to Lominoth for inspiring this set with recent talk of Ghost Curse. It seems bad, but with some key support, it rips walls into pieces that toxic and such cant touch. Give it a try, place some curses on your foes, and remember, its only a game. Why you heff to be mad?"

      "Next up are the Moves. Toxic Spikes are the KEY to this set, as they get you the Poisoned status needed for Merciless to activate. For those who never bothered to look at Merciless, its basic idea is “100% crit chance when hitting Poisoned Pokemon”. You simply need a single layer of Toxic Spikes to get this effect, making it easier, and less time invested, then normal to get the spikes up. Surf is picked over Scald as the extra power is best when building off Toxapex's weak SpA stat. For those wondering why not physical, Venoshock is why. A 130 base power stab move is just too good to pass up, especially when it crits 100% of the time. Recover is in the last slot as without EV's in Defences, Toxapex can be slightly frail, and recovery is always welcome. Its also going second most of the time, so it WILL be taking hits. If you feel you want more attacking power, Ice Beam can be included instead of Recover.",

Gravity can be a fun support option to deal with those second ones. Ground types are useful for the first, and those come in many flavours, so pick your favourite.",

All but 3 OU Fairy types are 2hko'd by CloseCombat. Ice Punch OHKO's every dragon type common to OU such as Garchomp and Zygarde, as well as OHKO'ing Mega-Latios, Salamence, and Dragonite. Resists to Ice Punch and CloseCombat's such as Blacephalon, Azumarill, and Tentacruel crumble under Kommo-o's powerful +1 CloseCombat and ice punch respectively. Offensive psychic types, mainly Mega-Medicham take heavy damage from CloseCombat as well, but you must be wary of your stat drops as mega-medicham has priority.",
      "Now after all of those impressive pokemon Kommo-o dominates, there are still a few pokemon Kommo-O has issues with. Mimikyu can break Kommo-o's substitute and can't be OHKO'd. Mega-Gardevoir, Mega-Altaria, and Sylveon's powerful stab Hyper Voice can pierce through substitute. Though offensive Mega-Altaria cannot survive a +1 Ice punch, Defensive can. don't gamble on that. Mega-Gardevoir cannot switch into a +1 CloseCombat and Ice Punch. Defensive pokemon like Toxapex, Slowbro, Mew, Sylveon, and Clefable wall Kommo-o and threaten it with Super-Effective moves, and stat resets. Though Toxapex without Haze can be added to the list of setup above, and Clefable without unaware are 2hko'd by ice punch at +3.",
      "This has been a Kommo-o moveset brought to you from w2 Corp, and I hope to see some in use soon."

      "Due to Larvitar’s poor bulk, speed, and attack stat it’s going to be needing a lot of team support. I’m talking about stuff like; Aurora Veil from Ninetales-Alola, Sticky Webs from Pokémon such as Araquanid or Ribombee. It also is going to need proper VoltTurn support from Pokémon such as Landorus-Therian and Tapu Koko since it can’t switch into any attack whatsoever.",
      "Larvitar is going to be unable to run eviolite due to it being very unlikely for it to get statused and needs status to actually damage Pokémon.",
      "I was sadly not able to do anything with its speed stat, 252 jolly allow larvitar to speed-tie with max speed neutral nature base 50 speed Pokémon such as Mega-Mawile and Azumarill. The Attack stat allows Larvitar to be a huge offensive threat at +1 while being burned, this allows larvitar to do a lot of damage to Pokémon such as Ferrothorn and Chansey, while also allowing it to OHKO Assault Vest Magearna, and Also OHKOs the best mon in the tier, ever created, for real the most fun Pokémon to play against Toxapex.",
      "The moves I picked are for clear reasons, Dragon Dance allows Larvitar to get its speed and attack up giving it more sweeping possibilities. Earthquake and Stone Edge give Larvitar two great STAB moves, these moves just make it so that Facade isn’t needed since they do more Damage than Facade. I put Superpower on this set so that Larvitar can heavily damage the afore mentioned Ferrothorn and Chansey, it won’t OHKO them at +1 but will still do heavily damage to them.",
      "Threats to this set, are physically defensive Pokémon like Hippowdon and Landorus-Therian, one of which has a deserved 50% usage stat :]. Other threats are fast pokemon since at +1 it will still be slower than most of the metagame. A good revenge killer will therefore be a good pick to pair with this Larvitar.",

It is quite easy for Scizor to set up, allowing it to clean, sweep or just get rid of Pokémon such as Magearna. Roost allows Scizor the keep Longevity during the whole battle, while also making it easier for Scizor to set up on the aforementioned Pokémon. Bullet Punch is Scizor’s Main STAB move, this move’s priority allows Scizor to take care of Diancie-Mega and Tapu Bulu more easily. Bullet Punch hits with a powerful force after set up. U-turn allows Scizor to bring in momentum in a battle through slow U-turns. Knock Off can be used over U-turn, this gives Scizor the ability to do heavy Damage to Pokémon such as Celesteela and Toxapex, both of which resist Scizor’s STAB moves. Knock Off also allows you to cripple opposing teams by knocking off leftovers or eviolite.",
      "252 HP with 204 Defence, and an impish nature allows Scizor to set up on multiple physical attackers who’s attacks it resists or takes neutral damage from in certain situations. The 28 attack EVs allow scizor to OHKO Assault Vest Tapu Bulu after a Swords Dance, it also OHKOs Mantine after 2 Swords Dances with Knock Off. The 20 Speed EVs allow scizor to outspeed a non-invested Heatran after mega evolving, this will not happen too often but it does not hurt the set to not use this investment. The 4 Special Defence EVs are leftover EVs due to level 50s EVs.",
      "If running knock off you want Scizor to knock off the items off of it checks as soon as possible. You can switch Scizor into attacks from Tapu bulu and Weavile and use them as set up fodder or, get more momentum onto your side by U-turning out when predicting a switch.",
      "Threats to this set are Pokémon such as Zapdos or Heatran so make sure you have a proper way to check these Pokémon when building around Scizor.",

      "Today, we're taking a look at a set I modified from VGC to work in Singles formats; It's Z Tailwind Kartana! Now you might ask: \"Wtf does Z Tailwind do?\" Basicly, it gives Kartana +2 crit rate, similar to Focus Energy, which allows Leaf Blade with its own +1 crit rate to crit EVERY SINGLE TIME!",
      "Let's look first at the full moveset. This Kartana runs a pretty standard attack lineup with the standard Leaf Blade, Sacred Sword and Knock Off or Smart Strike, together with Tailwind used over the Swords Dance or Defog slot. Leaf Blade is your main STAB move that crits every time after you set up Z Tailwind, which also lets your other 2 moves crit 50% of the time. Remember that the crit boost effect is only once per battle, and if you switch, its gone. Sacred Sword adds good coverage with its Fighting type, allowing you to hit Steel types that would otherwise wall Kartana. Lastly, Knock Off or Smart Strike add a small bit of extra coverage to your movepool.",
      "Then, the EVs. First, i made sure it could outspeed everything it needs to inside and outside Tailwind while keeping some leftover EVs for bulk. 172 Speed with the neutral Adamant nature allows it to hit 151 Speed, making it faster than all positive base 85 Pokémons, such as Tapu Fini and Suicune, as well as outrunning Kingdra in Rain when Tailwind is up. It also outruns Scarf Tapu Koko, and any other base 130 or below Scarfers when Tailwind is up. Next, i made sure to allow it to survive Specs Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt, while also allowing it to hit the nature jump point in Attack. Putting 20 points in HP and 164 in Special Defense allows it to survive this, and by using 148 points in Attack, it could hit the exact jump point that i was looking for. The remaining 4 points are invested into Defense.",
      "This gimmicky set does come with its usual weaknesses though. Certain Steel types such as Mega-Scizor, Skarmory and Celesteela with still wall Kartana no mather what, and should be knocked out before trying to set up. Partners such as Magnezone are recommended. A handful of other Pokémon such as Zapdos, Volcarona, and many Grass types will also be able to wall Kartana and prevent its sweeping potential. Lastly, you have only 3 effective turns to make use of Tailwind before it ends, making it more useful in the CLT 3v3s than in full 6v6s. The set has a very average speed tier outside of Tailwind, allowing common base 90+ speed threats to outrun it. I hope to see people try this set out soon. Good luck, and most importantly, have fun!"

Usually, people use the Assault Vest set that allows Muk-A to become a powerful special wall, however that moveset lacks any good recovery. So now, let's take a look at a new moveset for Muk-A that gives it the recovery it was looking for, thanks to the USUM Move Tutors.",
      "Due to a change made in Generation 7, the so-called Pinch Berries, or Super Sitrus Berries will now restore 50% of your max HP when your remaining HP is 25% or less (previously, 12.5% healed when under 50%), which is just as much as healing moves such as Recover or Roost. Thanks to the ability Gluttony, berries that would activate at 25% remaining HP will now activate at 50% instead! With the addition of Move Tutors to USUM, Muk-A now gets access to the move Recycle, which allows Muk-A to keep recovering its berry after eating it, giving it reliable recovery, until it runs out of PP. By allowing it to recover so easily, it can make good use of the move Curse, lowering its Speed, but raising its Attack and Defense in return. With a bit of setup, it can deal good damage with its a STAB Poison Jab, but you can deal even more damage thanks to Payback, a 50 basepower move that becomes 100 basepower if the user moves last, which should be no problem considering Curse lowers your speed. A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs help lowering your speed even further to increase the consistency in boosting Payback's power. Note that in Doubles battles, you likely want to pair Muk-A with a Trick Room user so it can become the fastest Pokémon on the field, which means Knock Off is a more consistent option over Payback in that case. Out of 5 different Pinch Berries, the Berry that we want to use is either Figy, Iapapa or Aguav. Mago Berry will Confuse Muk-A due to its Sassy nature, and Wiki Berry will reveal your Speed-lowered nature to your opponent by not Confusing it. The EVs and Nature allow Muk-A to be as Specially Defensive as possible, while hitting even numbers on both Attack and Defense at Lv50, which, due to the mechanics of the game, increases the efficiency of Curse (For Lv100, use 252HP 8Def 248SpDef instead). After a few Curses, Muk-A also becomes Physically Defensive on top of its Specially Defensive capabilities, making it very hard to knock out due to it's Berry recovery.",
      "As beautiful as it all may sound, like every Pokémon, this set has it's weaknesses. Ground-type Pokémon can hit Muk-A super effectively, and should be taken out before attempting to set up. Pokémon with the move Knock Off can remove Muk-A's berry and disable it's recovery for the entire battle. Lastly, Pokémon that can resist Muk-A's STAB moves and set up on it, such as Magearna and Mega-Mawile, can instantly turn your battle into a defeat.",
      "I'm hoping to see people use this set in action soon. Have a nice week everyone!"

At level 50, if you give it max speed EVs and a choice scarf, you have a whopping 220 speed, and that’s just with an adamant nature! It can outspeed koko and Greninja, two powerful mons in the OU teir!",

      "Ice Punch is a great way to fight off electric type’s biggest weakness, ground. I found it really useful against Landorus-T. Earthquake helps with mons like Magearna that are usually hard to deal decent damage to. Wild Charge is for STAB, which is the key to any moveset. Fire Punch is there to help with Ferrothorn, a mon that can bait electric types that is usually as tough to beat as Magearna. It is recommended that if you want to run volt switch, also run cross chop.",
      "Some recommended teammates are Landorus, because it can set up stealth rocks. This can give Electivire the opportunity to OHKO Mega Gyarados, which it can easily outspeed after it uses dragon dance once.  Another helpful teammate is Rotom-Wash, which can easily remove Sticky Webs, which are a big problem that this set faces, without being affected by them itself. Another mon that would be useful is Heatran, due to it carrying bulk and moves that teams with Electivire tend to lack.",
      "There aren’t really any downfalls to this mon, other than ground types after it is locked on to a move already, but if you switch into a mon with levitate or that is a flying type, you’ll be fine (which makes Rotom-Wash very helpful).",

      "Now, while not quite as strange as Choice Specs Scizor, Tangela may seem an odd choice of Pokémon in the current metagame, especially given the plethora of strong Legendary Pokémon swarming the most common slots of OverUsed. However, this Tangela proves a strong addition to many teams due to the large amount of utility it can provide to its teammates.",
      "To begin, you're probably thinking, \"MG, what in the world is that insane EV spread?\" Well, it does a lot of things. The Special Attack investment allows this Tangela to 2HKO all Zygarde variants (though some require Stealth Rock or prior damage) using Hidden Power Ice. The HP and Special Defense investment allows Tangela to avoid the 2HKO from any of Zap Plate Tapu Koko's attacks, while the Defense investment is the leftover EVs that also conveniently allow you to live a +2 Z-Outrage from offensive Zygarde and two uses of offensive Zygarde's +1 Outrage. The 4 Attack EVs are the leftover EVs that arise due to how EVs work at Level 50. A Relaxed Nature optimizes Tangela's performance as a physical wall. Regenerator is the best Ability for Tangela, as it allows it to heal itself when switched out.",
      "As for Tangela's moves, it has a few options regarding what it can use. For its first move slot, I personally recommend Leech Seed or Synthesis, though another move could be chosen if necessary. These moves provide Tangela with helpful recovery; Synthesis can be used if you're worried about Tangela getting hit with a critical hit or other strong attack, while Leech Seed can offer more gradual recovery that can annoy the opponent with residual damage. For the second slot, either Knock Off or Sleep Powder can work, Knock Off providing helpful utility for its teammates by removing items from opponents and Sleep Powder inflicting sleep (though it can be unreliable). Hidden Power Ice is necessary for this set to not be complete bait to Zygarde, allowing Tangela to damage it while it's setting up or attacking. Giga Drain is a nice STAB move that provides minor recovery and allows Tangela to damage its opponents a little bit while it's out.",
      "A few things I'd like to add is that Tangela isn't for every team. Due to its limited attacking power, Tangela often saps momentum and may require some prediction to maximize its potential as a pivot and wall. Additionally, it does require team support due to its inability to wall everything (especially special attackers and Fire-type opponents). Heatran and Toxapex provide very useful assistance in this area.",
      "This Tangela set was intended to capitalize on Eviolite in order to provide the assistance of Tangrowth without limiting its movepool or bulk through use of Assault Vest or investment into only one Defense stat. As such, many of Tangrowth's weaknesses (and more, since Tangela has less Attack, HP, and lacks Earthquake) are applied to Tangela. However, Tangela may also find it easy to find a spot on teams that require Tangrowth to certain degrees.",

      "Hyper Voice is the main move in this set. It’s incredibly spammable, dealing massive damage with 122 Base Power after STAB, Aerilate, and the multi-target debuff. It’s deadly to any Fighting, Bug, and Grass types in the tier, of which there are many. It has no drawbacks at all, and it breaks through a lot of Pokemon unboosted. 192 Special Attack Evs allows for a guaranteed 2HKO on Tapu Bulu provided Tailwind is up, a guaranteed 2HKO on 4 HP / 252+ SpD Amoonguss, and generally used to hit harder.",
      "UPDATE: With Swagger being banned in DOU and Marshadow declared safe for the meta, Hyper Voice is a safe 2HKO on Marshadow, with the first hit reaching a minimum of 80.9% damage, leaving it in a critical position to be double targeted. In comparison, Spectral Thief can",
      "do a 99.6% 2HKO (Assuming two 85 rolls). This required a change from Hasty to Naive in Natures to lower this to just under 34%.",
      "Earthquake provides the necessary coverage to deal with most of the Pokemon that are resistant to Flying type moves. It has 75 base power, has great coverage across the board, and hits quite a lot of relevant Pokemon in the tier for super-effective damage, especially Heatran, Alolan Marowak, Tapu Koko, Aegislash, and Tyranitar, among others. The given Evs allow Salamence to 2HKO Tapu Koko after a Tailwind.",
      "Roost is pretty self explanatory, allowing Salamence to heal itself when it gets to low health. It can also be used to live strong Ice attacks by turning the Flying type Salamence has into Normal Type, thus bringing the effectiveness down to 2x. Protect can also be used if you want to avoid double targets and punish them accordingly.",
      "It should be worth noting, however, that this set has a major crutch - it needs to have Tailwind up in order to function. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko can outspeed Salamence and KO it 75% of the time without Tailwind, and even then, you only have a 25% chance to 2HKO. Unless Tapu Bulu is the one you’re facing, it’s a good idea to switch Salamence out on a Tapu, as all of them can 2HKO or OHKO with a Fairy Type move (except Bulu....)",
      "It is also very important to note that this set is completely walled by Wide Guard. If the opposing team has a Wide Guard user out, it may not be a good idea to bring Salamence in.",
      "Salamence M is best suited on its team with Steel and Fairy type checks. Heatran and Aegislash are great at this. Along with this, Salamence appreciates Water type checks because they almost always carry Ice Type moves. Specs Tapu Koko and Rotom Wash work well, depending on what team type you have (Hyper Offense or Bulky Offense). Lastly, Electric type support is great, as most carry Hidden Power Ice, which Salamence is almost always KO’d by. Assault Vest Landorus-T comes to mind, but if you don’t want the Ice Weakness on your Ice Check, Tyranitar can be a good option too.",

      "First off the reason why you'd this set though. this set, compared to Assault Vest or Scarf, well first of all AVs case is that most of buzzwole's resists are physically based and most of the time the typing super effective against it are mainly specially based, this and the lack of reliable recovery because of the amount of types bug and fighting are resisted by, makes AV buzzwole a real waste of a Pokémon and of a proper wall. and i just have a dislike towards below base 100 scarfers, cant even revenge kill set up sweepers and it's also outclassed by other fighting type scarfers such as infernape.",
      "Roost and leftovers are your ways to recover off taken damage, allowing buzzwole to have a lot of longevity during the battle. earthquake on this set is for Pokémon such as Heatran, Tapu Koko, Magearna, and Mega-Mawile. Ice punch is mainly used for the ground types that buzzwole can wall with ease, garchomp and zygarde for example. hammmer arm is your main STAB spam move, this allows you to take care of Pokémon such as Tyranitar and Chansey, you can choose to run drain punch over hammer arm if you're like that, just note the lack in power you will get from that and how the recovery is not worth it when you already have Roost. you can also opt to run Superpower but, the Stat drops will bite you more than the speed loss will.",
      "the EVs are pretty easy to understand. 60 EVs are put in attack to allow you to 2HKO AV magearna with 12 defense EVs. the 116 EVs in speed make it so that Buzzwole can outspeed adamant Tyranitar and thus speedtie with defensive Landorus-Therian. furthermore, the EVs in HP and defense + an impish nature allow you to dodge the 2HKO from banded tyranitar, and the 4 spdef EVs are just leftover from level 50s.

Hope for a three turn sleep. Once you got a Plot and a back up Plot, you start attacking for tons of damage.",
      "When to set up is important. You dont want anything that avoids Fighting/Psychic moves to still be around. You also want to set up on a Pokemon that hits your special defense for neutral or resisted damage. Hypno is frail on the defense, but has a solid SpD, so for the love of Hypnosis, never set up on a physical attacker.",
      "The Evs are basic Sweeper Evs, nothing special really. The ability is a toss up between avoiding being counter sleeped or avoiding flinch attempts.",
      "I would like to thank Boris and Konno Tohiro for inspiring this set. Without their work, I would never have been driven to make this set work the way it does. Thanks to them, I have a new love of Hypno, and really wanted to share how it can do some solid damage. And no, I'm not hypnotized. I just have a love of fine art involving this lovable Baku. Did you know Musharna and Hypno are based on the same source? Which isn't even an old myth, it was a recent marketing campaign for a stuffed toy that they advertised to be like a dream catcher"

      "Hello Silver League, this is your local flower girl Sadia. I would like to present to you my mascot Valentine. Basis aside this pokemon is a very under rated and should get more attention. It highest stat is Sp Attack at 125 105 Sp Def and respectable speed at 95. It can be a Speedy Special attacker, a support hazard or a scarf mon. Getting off topic lets get to the set itself and how it works",
      "Starting with the item I choose life orb to take full advantage of its modest nature. The downside of having a modest nature is of course getting out speed by mons that are faster than Roserade. It’s a risk vs reward but reward is worth it if you can pull it off. The key to pulling off this is when you switch into Roserade or in some cases you might have it out already. If you predict your oppent switching. You would use sub to a free turn without damage then if for an example your opponent switches into poplar steel types such as Hearten you can hit them with a Hidden Power Ground to get some massive damage. Hidden Power Fire is also good for most steel types such as Scizor. It’s basically a Kunoichi (a female ninja) beautiful and deadly when used correctly.",
      "As for evs it is the standard evs for sp attackers but you would of noticed I invested some in it’s HP rather than lets say sp def it’s because Roserade can be crippled by any physical attacks and that 4 hp evs may help you in a pinch if you manage to survive a hit from you can hit them back hard enough to say “think you got me pegged well how about I hit you right back. And Roserade will make the ultimate sacrifice for her teammates and have a free switch on for other pokemon to come in and pick up the kill.",
      "I would like to thank Conor and Diogo for helping me with this set. Diogo helped with the idea that Roserade can be a ninja by being sneaky and deadly and also there was the episode of the anime with Roserade as an actual ninja so that’s where me and Diogo got that idea from. Conor also helped with his set cuz he gave me the idea that you can use sub plus hidden power ground/fire to get a sneak attack on your opponent doesn’t expect a hidden power ground on a Roserade."

      "Hello Silver League, Crystal here! With the recent events resulting in me getting Dragon Gym, I thought I should celebrate by giving my favorite dragon, some time in the sun for this week. That dragon type is Crimson, aka, Druddigon!",
      "Now Druddigon is not the best dragon in the world, in fact it’s outclassed by many of its dragon brethren. However, it has many tricks up its sleeve to make it stand out. Let’s start out with its ability Sheer Force. As long as you use a move that gets benefits from Sheer Force, Life Orb will not drain Druddigon’s HP. Be wary though, using Dragon Claw or Sucker Punch will still drain HP when used, so be sure to time your moves correctly to avoid unnecessary HP loss. Gunk Shot and Fire Punch are possibly the best coverage moves you can give Druddigon, as it helps with a few threats standing in its way, and that’s where the EV spread comes into play.",
      "Druddigon doesn’t necessarily need speed to be good, which is why Adamant + 252 in Attack is a must to maximize its damaging moves. However, 108 in Speed is to not only outspeed fully defensive Clefable or speedtie with Clefable with 4 Speed EVs, it can also one shot it with Gunk Shot combined with its ability, item, and Attack investments since those together can get around Unaware Clefable. Tangrowth is also 2 Shot by Gunk Shot. Fire Punch is amazing coverage on Druddigon, as it can deal heavy blows to defensive steel types, examples being that it can 2 shot Physically Defensive Skarmory along with Celesteela. STAB Dragon Claw isn’t something to scoff at either, as it can 2 Shot Specially Defensive Gastrodon. The rest of the EVs go into HP to tank hits considering it’s respectable 90 in both defenses.",
      "Timing is everything when it comes to this set, especially when it comes to predicting switching. Once you get Druddigon on the field safely, it can dish out a lot of damage to bulkier mons since it doesn’t require setup to be good. With good coverage moves, it’s a force to be reckoned with. It can be a major threat that mons such as fairies can’t switch into easily. So with that being said, Druddigon is a very nice pick for not only Dragon Gym, but any team that needs a wall breaker. "

We will supplement it with moves that take out common electric checks, such as Ferrothorn, Landorus, and Zygarde. The first move fulfilling our goal will be Work-Up. Work-Up boosts a pokemon's attack and special attack by 1 stage. While Zeraora's stats may seem low, once one Work Up has been used, it is capable of sweeping with raw power that a majority of OU pokemon cannot handle.",
      "Plazma-Fists will be our main attack. 100BP, it turns any normal type moves used after Zeraora into an Electric type move, activating Zeraora's Volt Absorb. It is capable of 2HKO'ing defensive Mega-Scizor, Rotom-Wash, and even Unaware Clefable at +1. Some frail pokemon that resist Plasma-Fists, such as Serperior, are also 2hko'd at +1, and can OHKO many regular pokemon, such as Assault-Vest Alolan-Muk and threatens many defensive cores. With Volt Absorb, Zeroara is safe from most Electric types such as Mega-Manectric, and Tapu-Koko. Zeraora however, does defeat itself with Close-Combat. Our second attack is going to be Close Combat. Zeraora can use +1 close combat to OHKO Ferrothorn, and 2HKO's on Assault-Vest Tangrowth, Gastrodon, and Intimidate Arcanine. It also OHKO's Chansey, and Tyranitar, who otherwise tank Plasma-Fists. Our final move is an electric coverage staple. Hidden-Power Ice. While Hidden Powers can be a pain, Zeroara needs it to setup sweep. Zeraora with 4 EV's in SpA with one Work-Up is guaranteed to OHKO on all pokemon 4x weak to Ice. and secures 2HKO's against most Dragon types, such as Mega-Latios, and Kommo-o. While this may look really amazing, no set is without its checks and counters.",
      "While Zeraora's coverage is amazing, there are a few pokemon it is unable to break. Mega-Venusaur cannot be touched by Zeraora, Hippowdon isn't hurt enough by HP Ice, even at +1. Buzzwole's swole mosquito muscles bounce attacks off of it like rubber. While Mega-Latios is solidly 2HKO'd by HP Ice, Mega-Latias isn't, and can stall you out with recover as your life orb drains your HP. Bulky ground-waters such as Gastrodon and Swampert check Zeraora, as you can 2HKO with close combat, but they can OHKO back. Alolan-Marowak can only be hit with HP Ice, which won't get you anywhere and unaware Quagsire doesn't know what Gen it is.",
      "Zeraora can output a lot of damage, OHKO'ing many common Electric checks in the game, but it must be careful. As a fast setup sweeper that naturally outspeeds most of the META-game, it's also very frail, and is vulnerable to priority and choice scarfs. To help it sweep, pair Zeraora on a team with solid matchups against bulky ground types such as Hippowdon, and Quagsire. Do not setup Zeraora early; It's risky when you haven't found out what pokemon sets your opponent has that you otherwise setup on. Zeraora functions best in mid-to late game when all opponents check pokemon are worn down, and you can easily setup. However, if you do not see any hard counters and checks such as Mega-Venusaur and Alolan-Marowak, you can be safe setting up early."

      "Hello Silver League, Dave here. Before I begin, I have to thank Roki for sharing his idea for an Analytic set, but I did decide to expand upon the EV spread before sharing it. We have a lot to cover so let’s get started.",
      "Normal has no resistances so it seems strange to lean towards physical defense, but the majority of Porygon2's prey are physical attackers. The EV spread allows Porygon2 to avoid a 2HKO from an Offensive Landorus-T (Outside a Z-Fly), Choice Banded Thousand Arrows, Garchomp, Life Orb Kyurem-Black, +1 Mega Gyarados, and Mamoswine. The leftover EVs were meant to all go into HP, but at level 50, sometimes 4 EVS can’t raise a stat. 60 Evs had the same results as 64 (the same thing happens with 188 to 192 EVs). So I decided to dump the rest into Special Defense. The set does let it take one strong hit from a Special Wallbreaker. For example, it can take one Specs boosted Hydro Pump from Ash Greninja, but Porygon2’s slow speed guarantees that it’d be taken out next turn.",
      "The EV spread certainly lets Porygon2 take plenty of punishment, but dozens of Pokemon have decent bulk. Thankfully, Porygon2’s respectable 105 Special Attack and Analytic give it something to stand out. As long as Porygon2 moves last, Analytic increases the power of all of its moves by 30 percent. This includes your opponent switching their Pokemon.",
      "All of these factors let Porygon2 easily remove quite a few threats. Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 2HKO on Celesteela, Specially Defensive Skarmory, and Tapu Fini. It also OHKO Mega Gyarados, and Pelipper. Ice beam is an excellent coverage move that lets Porygon2 OHKO Garchomp, Zygarde, Landorus, Non-Assault Vest Tapu Bulu (with Stealth Rocks), and Gliscor. Tri Attack is a respectable STAB that can 2HKO Kyurem-Black and Mamoswine. Lastly, Recover is pretty self-explanatory.",
      "Porygon2 can take a few hits, but it still can’t be used too carelessly. Porygon2 is devastated by Fighting Types, Knock Off, Toxic, Heatran, Tyranitar, and Special Wallbreakers. Strong prediction and the right timing can allow Porygon2 to destroy major threats, but it needs to be handled with care. Thank you for reading, and I hope you’ll find success with this set."

      "The nice thing of this set is you don't have to go looking for a HA one, so you can just get any random one to breed. Oblivious lets it avoid Taunt, which is great as it lets it keep setting up as taunt is useless. Brave is there as an option, but you can use Sassy or Relaxed if you want. It doesn't really matter, but speed is ok to drop and you want to boost some kind of Defense or its Attack.",
      "Curse is the main move, and should be spammed as soon as anything that would punch through Slowking before it sets up is gone. Getting that boost up makes it drastically harder to kill. If you start to take too much damage, Slack Off brings you back up to better HP. The two attacking moves are picked for their coverage. Note, Skarmory and Scizor wall you, kill them first. Another option for either is Aqua Tail, as it lets you hit some different things. The other silly option you might think about is Dive. Its easily",
      "predictable, BUT lets you get more healing in from Leftovers which, once curse is set up, means they can barely scratch you.",
      "EV spread is basic, understandable, and meant to make you tanky as you set up, relying on Curse for damage. You could think about swapping the SpD EV's to Defense or Attack, but spreading out your Bulk is good. Lets you come in on a special attacker then set up as they cant hurt you.",
      "Toxic, Haze, and any other anti set up or wall moves really screw with the set. Finding ways to deal with those are key support. Slowking normally is very relaxed, but sometimes, stress gets to him all at once, and he lets loose with some naughty words, and busts a move on his foes. The calm wall gets brave and throws off its modest side as it adamantly gets sassy at those who thought it was timid. Slowking has had enough, and will make you sit down, shut up, and learn to respect this King."

      "This Set is designed to counter steel type walls, setup and physical sweepers. Torracat while not being bulky to begin with comes with intimidate. That with eviolite makes torracat capable of at least taking one hit from a physical attacker, but add in will o wisp and torracat can easily take super effective hits if it out speeds and burns a mon trying to take it out. The one thing you’ll need to keep in mind is speed. If you’re thinking you might be outsped swap out this cat into something that can deal with it. Torracat being a fire type makes it ideal for forcing a switch against ferrothorn and scizor, use that opportunity to use u turn to get in a little damage and switch in your counter measures safely. Your last two moves are your stab flamethrower and your taunt. Taunt is one of the most important moves on this set so use it wisely.",
      "This set does have weaknesses. Despite the previous tangent of torracat’s surprising bulk most players are smart enough to not to fall for it and if you can’t set it up properly you will not being keeping you cat out for long. Torracat has a lot of utility and so when you come across a match up that could easily take it out be careful of your next move as you might need it later. Since most of torracat’s bulk is on the physical side it is ill advised that you send it against special attackers unless you have type advantage against their moves with some exceptions. Serperior in particular is a bad matchup as it can easily beat torracat with contrary leaf storm and players can switch into heatran if you try to burn their pokemon. Torracat is not supposed to work alone and so it is recommended that you build a team that can both benefit from it’s utility and support it when it’s in a pickle.",

In this we will covering one of my favorite bug types, and on of my favorite Pokemon in general, Yanmega. With a both a good base special attack and speed stat, along with access to stab air slash and probably the most crucial component to set it apart from other bug flying types, it being given the speed boost ability. This allows the already fast dragonfly, keep getting faster each and every turn. Now let's get to the set.",
      "The main purpose of this set is to not just be a fast sweeper, it's true beauty lies in its ability to flinch opponents to death by abusing its speed with a stab air slash’s 30 percent chance to flinch. For those that really want to drive their opponents insane, you can even add a king’s rock to give its two other attacking moves a 10 percent chance to flinch as well. A more practical item would be a focus sash, as this gives Yanmega at least a few guaranteed turns on the field, as the first thing done when using this set, is to protect turn one, to give yourself an automatic plus one in speed. Since the first three moves are pretty easy to understand why they are on here, let’s finish up by talking about giga drain. Giga drain is the cherry on top of this set, as what fun is using a fast sweeper if it can’t recover some of the HP it’s lost along the way? Giga drain gives flinchy boi back some of its HP while also dealing out good damage to ground, rock and water types.",
      "However like all bug flying types, Yanmega does need some support and backing from other mons with defog or rapid spin to get rid of rocks. Yanmega also needs some bulky walls and at least one more attacking teammate, one that preferably can cover for types that yanmega has problems with, one of the big threats being steel types, so any number of good bulky ground types take care of not only the steel types, but also can be switched in on the electric and fire types that also threaten Yanmega.",
      "And with that, there is the set for the flinchy boi Yanmega, I simultaneously hope and not hope to see more of these things on the field. I love using it, but dear god is it not a fun time to be flinched to death by it. Sorry to those in advance that may soon be fighting more of these things. "

With good natural bulk and a great defensive typing of pure water Pyukumuku is a great wall that can be built in a couple of different ways but I prefer the physically defensive variant.",
      "Lets jump right into what this set is meant to do. 248 in HP and 252 in Defense is to maximize the physical bulk while the remaining bit is put into special defense to give a slight boost to Pykumuku's respectable base 130 special Defense. Toxic is the main way this set has of dealing damage and can be used to stall out special attackers that bother this build. The combination of taunt and counter is used late game to force physical attackers out or flat out KO them. Lastly recover paired with leftovers is crucial to keep Pyukumuku healthy. Taunt is also used to keep foes from stacking hazards.",
      "Pokémon that can take advantage of super effective moves targeted at pyukumuku make great partners. Mega Manectric stands out as it can hold off on mega evolving long enough to get a free buff from any electric attacks that target Pyukumuku. Specially defensive Pokémon like assault vest Tangrowth and Goodra also make great partners because of the defensive synergy they have with physically bulky water types.  Lastly you will want a cleric of some type to heal any of the numerous status conditions that can limit Pyukumuku's Longevity.",
      "Now on to the downsides. This set is very weak to taunt users and substitute. Pyukumuku is also very passive since it has no damaging moves other than counter and bide so a strong wall breaker or Z-move can break past it very easily. Mold breaker Pokémon also prove to be a massive problem because they simply bypass unaware and can easily break pass Pyukumuku or use it as setup fodder.",
      "Other options for Pyukumuku are a more stall based set of Block ,Spite , Toxic, and Recover which can be used to pp stall opponents that can't deal with Pyukumuku's bulk. Soak is also a very good option over Counter in order to allow you to toxic poison and steel type Pokémon which usually wall other . Z-memento can be used to heal a teammate after Pyukumuku has served its main purpose and can be ran over counter but you also lose leftovers recovery . Light screen or reflect are also an option that allows pyukumuku to support its team in a different way than usual. lastly lets talk about some less desirable sets. a specially defensive build can be used but the lack of Mirror coat makes it less desirable and a mixed defensive set isn't ideal because of Pyukumuku's less than ideal HP stat.",
      "In short Pyukumuku is a fun mon to use even though it does need a bit of support. With the right team and a little bit of creative play it can put in some serious work. Thanks for reading."

On this day however, JEARS goon Dru came up with a most ridiculous concept: Seel, with Whirlpool and Perish Song.`,

      "Hey SL, Amber here with a doubles build Goodra design for you all. The basic idea behind this Goodra is an heavy tank that can stick around and nip away with damage. It is meant to be paired with a rain Pokemon like Pelipper for hydration to enable it to wake up from resting, and the focus sash will prevent a OHKO before it can rest, it's bulk would make Leftovers an option as well though as a OHKO would be difficult without setup. It works wonderfully in a U-turn switch in from a Pelipper who sets rain at the start of a match, and even better if you have a trick room up to take advantage of it's lower speed with the relaxed Nature. The move set is designed to have a stab, a move boosted by the rain, and coverage along with rest. With the EVs spread and max IVs in HP, Defense, and Special defense at level 50 this build will have 165 HP, 134 Defense, and 202 Special defense, while being at max of 90 speed for that trick room set up to have a good chance of getting rest activated before being hit if at low HP.  Thanks to Hydration as long as the rain is still up it will wake up it's next turn, and will also heal itself from any poison, paralyze, or burn while it is raining as well giving it even greater staying power.",
      "Ideal Teammates:",
      "Pelipper to have rain up, Mimikyu for trick room, Toxapex for another rain boosted wall to divide attack focus. I personally find Malamar to work well with this build as well as a contrary Malamar can boost itself up with superpower, making the coverage choice on Goodra more simple and reset trick room as well in an emergency.</p><p>I know Doubles is not the most popular format here in SL, but I do hope you will enjoy giving this build a try sometime.",
      "I hope you enjoy this set.",
      "EDITOR NOTE: Due to the rules in place regarding MOTWs, Thunderbolt and Power Whip were not listed with the other moves, but please keep them in mind for alternative options depending on the team you're putting together."

      "Here I go once again with the email, every week I hope that it’s from a female. So I was slowly running out of good meme ideas for sets, after such great hits like Ryan the godslaying Corphish and HymenBuster1 the lucky punch Chansey, I needed something to follow up on the trend of absolutely garbage Pokemon sets to dick around with. Then I hit me, back to the beautiful early days of the internet, I remember how in its genesis, Strong Bad emails and Trogdor the Burninator were born. I think to my myself what dragon type could fit the bill the best for such an incredible idea, then it hit me, the beefiest armed dragon type there is, DRUDDIGON! He has wings, spinities, beefy arms, and a spiky tail. The only problem was getting a Pokemon with only a very small amount of fire attacks to become the burninator of all. However, I was able to make it work, ladies and gentlemen, I give you, Trogdor the Druddigon!",
      "In total, Druddigon has seven fire type attacks, only 2 of which being at all useful, the rest being just about as useful as Aqua. And in the context of Druddigon, really only fire punch makes sense. Having three attacking fire type moves, gives Druddigon a nice wide range to hit ice types, grass types, steel types, and the ever powerful bug type. Wrapping up, giving it sunny day allows Druddigon to not only boost the power of its fire type attacks to even greater levels, but it also allows it to become an effective sun-setter for others on this beasts team. Items like flame plate and charcoal give the fire attacks an even greater boost in power, possibly even knock types that take neutral damage down to ¼ health. Being such a slow boy, this",
      "Druddigon mostly works best on a trick room team, with other slow and strong Pokemon, like Escavalier and Pokemon like a trick room setting Mimikyu for coverage. In terms of EV spreads, max special attack and HP give Druddigon the best possible special attack stat and the bulk to be able to stay on the field, giving the last little bit of EV’s to its attack to keep that stat good as well. Have fun with Pokemon with Flash Fire, or just resist fire attacks in general. This maybe one of the worst sets I have made."],

      "Hey guys Abel back again with one of my favorite underrated Pokémon, Vileplume! Vileplume is often overlooked as a defensive grass type because of the sheer bulk and access to regenerator of the Pokémon that are Tangrowth and Amoongus, however Vileplume has access to something they don't! The wonderful move that is Strength sap! Strength sap allows Vileplume to reduce the attack stat of any physical attacker that makes contact with it while also healing HP.",
      "Now on to what makes this set tick. First of all a bold nature with full investment in defense and 248 IVs in HP gives Vileplume the bulk it needs to act as a defensive pivot. Effect spore is the ability of choice since the 30% chance of status on contact can cripple one of our opponents threats and black sludge paired with giga drain and strength sap gives Vileplume the recovery it needs to stay healthy as long as possible. The leftover IVs are put into special attack just to give a boost to Vileplume's stab attacks.",
      "Strength sap is the key move of this set. A recovery move that isn't affected by an opponent's unfavorable weather condition is huge for a Pokémon that used to have to rely on moonlight, plus the attack drop can be enough to force a switch out. Sludge bomb is the main STAB option for Vileplume as it does decent damage and has a chance to poison. Giga drain is our secondary stab and completes the recovery package. Lastly sleep powder is used a utility option against switch ins that would normally wall Vileplume or try to use it as setup fodder and it lets us potentially get a free turn to swap to a setup sweeper of our own.",
      "Specially bulky water types for a nice defensive core with Vileplume as they cover the weakness to fire and ice and many of them can provide hazard removal for the team with either rapid spin or defog. Heatran is a great partner for Vileplume as they cover each others resistances nicely and Heatran can deal with the steel types that wall this particular Vileplume build.",
      "Vileplume can also function decently as a sun sweeper. access to chlorophyll and a respectable 110 base special attack stat paired with a modest nature and growth can make it a decent threat on sun teams.",
      "In closing a would like to make a very special Thank You to Shiinotic. For letting Vileplume use its signature move and just being a fun guy in general. Thanks for reading, Abel"

      "Alolan-Marowak is an interesting pokemon. It's typing is very helpful against common offensive pokemon, and its variety of attacks are threatening to many defensive cores. While its stats may look unappealing at first, it can become a defensive and offensive powerhouse capable of checking and countering a large selection of pokemon found in the metagame.",
      "For our set, we will focus on Marowak's unique ability to abuse its EV's and Lightning Rod in a way no other pokemon in the game can. Thanks to thick club, Marowak is capable of reaching attack output on par with power houses such as Darmanitan and Mega Charizard with little EV investment. While speed is an important stat, Marowak won't outspeed much regardless. So, we will be taking its impressive typing and put into its bulk. Max HP gives Marowak the most bulk possible, and gives it an odd HP number to help combat its stealth rock weakness. 208 SpD EV's will allow Marowak impressive tanking ability, allowing it to survive one earth power from Heatran, and even survive Psyshock/Psychic from Scarf Tapu Lele after stealth rock. With an immunity to Electric from its ability, Marowak is capable of remaining untouched by many electric types you will see, such as Tapu Koko, and Zapdos, both of which will never be able to touch Marowak. Non-choice band Tapu Bulu will struggle to KO Marowak aswell. What's left is put into attack, giving Marowak higher attack than a Mega Charizard-X.",
      "Our moves are made for punishing common cores, and to lure certain pokemon which would otherwise deal with any normal Marowak set. Flare-Blitz is our most powerful fire option, capable of 2HKO'ing offensive Landorus variants. Frail pokemon that resist fire will be unable to safely come into play, such as Greninja. Shadow Bone is great stab, and can punish pokemon that don't resist our other attacks, has relatively no consequences, and is great when you have hard choices to make with your other coverage. Bonemerang can bypass Sturdy, and focus sash while also being unhindered by Grassy Terrain's effects, making it better than Earthquake allowing Marowak to be placed on teams with Tapu Bulu, and fight against common Bulu cores featuring Toxapex, and Heatran. With Flare Blitz, this can defeat the dreaded Toxapex Heatran Celesteela core, and combat standard Stall teams using Skarmory, Toxapex, and Mega Sableye. Stealth rock is a good choice, as Marowak pressures many pokemon allowing free rocks, while also being immune to Rapid Spin. Thunder Punch allows Marowak to combat bulky water types such as Tapu Fini as it reliably 2hko's, and also can be used to combat Hawlucha. In electric terrain, Marowak can potentially 1hko Hawlucha with Thunder Punch after it has its defense buff. Be wary however, if Hawlucha has a swords dance, it will KO Marowak. Worth mentioning, Toxic and Will-o-wisp are great all round choices. Some things just can't be hurt with these 3 moves, but can with Toxic and Will-O-Wisp.",
      "Be wary when using Marowak. Hazards pressure Marowak, and it's prone to Pursuit users. Above all else, always be mindful of losing your item. Scout for knock off users. I'd recommend pairing with Tapu Bulu to negate Earthquake and water weakness. Z move users/mega's resisting dark are also nice, as Marowak will have no issues retreating into it."

Two the other two abilities do nothing here. Lucky for Venonat it can evolve so it gets the nice item in Evolite which gives it 50% buff to both defs. Ev speard is my basic speard for curse sets.

Curse is the play here free Att and Def, which one makes it harder to kill and that att helps with Leech Life which does more damage and more healing. Rest and Sleep Talk are basic, free HP to take a nap, Sleep Talk to go with luck and try and not be a sitting bug. Now this does need mons to help deal with Zards Heatran Skarm etc aka anything that can hit like a train or something that holds down venonat/phase it out, things like rotom-w help here, garchomp can help too but there's a good number of mons that can hinder this set so it does need the help lol."

I have been using Chimecho as a staple on my teams since early generation 6 and it hasn’t let me down yet. Now, it does take some setup to work, but when it gets a few cosmic powers up, it becomes nearly unkillable. I was battling a Machamp that came in to deal with my Chimecho after it had a chance to get a pair of Cosmic Powers off, and it shrugged off a knock off from a guts burned Machamp, which there is little that’ll have a more powerful Knock Off without setup. After that, I proceeded to take out most of my opponent’s team with a Stored Power sweep.",

Having a fighting type pokemon on the team or a hard hitting pokemon with fighting type coverage will go a long way in supporting Chimecho. Luckily, fighting coverage is fairly easy to come by.",

When this happens, you can use either Heal Bell to support the rest of the team or use Healing Wish, a move very few pokemon have access to, and fewer still that would have room to fit it into their move sets, to fully restore another member of your team.",

This set may seem on the off side, but it is purely meant to take advantage of all the quad weaknesses some of the big OU boys have. With its natural bulk and high attack stat this thing will live nearly every hit on the block and even the ones it doesn’t have a 100% chance of living, there is a chance if you set up one curse and then you can take out a big threat with one solid punch. Garchomp? Boom ice punch and gone. Scizor? Bam, fire punch gone. Z bounce gyrados? Bang thunder punch gone. The best part about it is even mons that don’t have quad weaknesses, it can still do a giant chunk to them. Added in the chance for any of the four effects depending on what you hit and you can tilt everyone right off the battlefield with the power of RNG.",
      "Alolan Muk has its downsides like its very low speed tier, but it is more then made up for with its dark typing giving it a psychic immunity and only one weakness in that of ground. The best part about the set is that your opponent will never see the moves coming. Most Muks go for STAB poison and dark moves and a priority shadow sneak with only one elemental punch for some coverage or curse set up. This means that if your opponent sees one punch they won’t expect the other. “Oh he fire punched my Scizor? Guess that means I’m free to go to Gyrados.” WRONG! Zap that lizard and send it back to the ball leaving the opponent shaking their head both in utter confusion why anyone would run a double punch set and that they actually lost to it.",
      "The EVs are pretty self-explanatory on this set. Max attack for maximum damage and Max HP to have as much bulk as possible. The final 4 go into defense because most of the treats nowadays tend to be on the physical side and any special ones can’t normally OHKO Muk thanks to its natural base 100 Sp.def. These give you the best odds of surviving any hit before dishing back a good ole quad effective hit right to them and erasing a big threat from your team. Add in a very good wish passer and you can even get more then one mon down if they are",

Firstly the main gimmick here is belly drum which will be boosting Walrein's awful 80 attack to the max. Since Walrein is also pitifully slow at base 65 we'll want to give it some kind of speed boost. The only opportunity Walrein has to boost its speed is via the +1 boost that Z-rain dance gives.",

The second attacking move is more problematic as Walrein's coverage is very poor and it can only hit certain things depending on the moves it selects. With Ice fang it can hit grass types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu for high damage. With earthquake it can hit Toxapex and with Return it can hit Rotom-wash for high damage. It is also worth noting that for a choice of ability Thick fat or Oblivious can be used depending on your preference.",

Spikes Ferrothorn or stealth rock Landorus pair well due to covering type weaknesses and providing hazard support.

Ash-greninja is probably in the top 2 offensive threats of generation 7, together with it's amazing STABs and great speed Ash-greninja outspeeds most of the unboosted metagame and has priority to take on other priority users or set up sweepers that have taken chip damage.",
      "The moveset is a very obvious regular build, Dark pulse gives ash-gren a great Stab spam move to either put Pokémon in range of other threats on your team, to pull off a late game sweep or to simply give a safe spam option because you're getting choiced into it with specs. Spikes might seem very strange for a lot of newer people in the competitive scene, but following the basedlords words, ash-greninja forces out a lot of pokemon and puts a lot of pressure onto teams beating out U-turn in this spot because the overall utility ash-gren can manage to get by putting up spikes is a lot better than the occasional momentum that u-turn will give you due the very reliable chip damage taken by spikes which can also put a lot of Pokémon in range of Ash-gren's- or it's teammates attacks. Hydro Pump should probably always be used over Surf on Greninja, the damage output of surf can not even compare to this move's, Hydro Pump gets ash-greninja a lot of KOs which it needs to even activate Battle Bond it's very easy to say you either miss the move or miss the kill with this comparison, Hydro pump mows through a lot of common walls with neutral damage and simply outclasses surf. Last but not least there is the multiple hit priority move Water Shuriken. Water Shuriken can actually sweep teams in the late game if ash-gren is played well, The move's chance to hit five times and literally outspeed even more things that ash-gren didn't before makes sure that there is a lot of offensive pressure on the opponent. There is a lot more to say about it's moves but this is the simplest way to put it.",

      "Let’s start off with Z-heal block, using your Z-move on heal block will give latios +2 in special attack and still disable every recovery move that the opponent has, this allows it to both set up on a lot of stall pokemon and cancel them from stalling out your latios. Psyshock can be used as an emergency z-move in late game but it’s main use is to take care of specially defensive walls in stall such as chansey and Toxapex which take a lot of damage from it after heal block and  can’t stall out latios. Roost serves to give Latios longevity throughout it’s stalbreaking, while most stall teams don’t do a lot of damage, they are able to chip Latios but Roost allows Latios to heal this off. Ice beam gives Latios great coverage against opposing Dragon types but also defeating common OU pokemon such as Landorus- and Tornadus-therian.",
      "The EV spread is a simple 252/252, the special attack allows Latios to hit as hard as possible so it can break through stall and other teams. The speed put into Latios allows it to speed tie with base 110 Pokemon but also outspeed Major threats like Kartana and Blacephalon. Latios is able to kill both with ice beam or psyshock depending on the Pokemon due to their lacking defensive stats. If you do not care for speed or want to know the exact Power of kills with latios you can always opt for a more bulky spread but taking out EVs out of either one of these sets so Latios can get a bit more durability and set up more comfortably.",

Assault vest with maximum hp investment allows Komala to be as bulky as possible while pivoting into status and removing hazards for your team. Maximum attack investment with an adamant nature boost Komala's decent base 115 attack stat so it can hit as hard as possible while on the field.",

Komala is naturally fairly slow with a base speed of only 65 so being able to provide a safe switch to a sweeper via a slow u-turn comes in very handy. Sucker punch allows Komala to beat Pokemon like Gengar and Blacephalon that would otherwise stop it from being able to rapid spin. And finally Return is the main STAB move for Komala.",
      "Physically bulk psychic types like Cresselia and Reuniclus make great partners for komala. They can take on the fighting types like Mega Medicham that threaten komala. Pokemon like choice scarf kartana and Mega Lopunny appreciate the slow uturn that komala provides as they can come in safely without taking damage, and finally any Pokemon that appreciates hazard removal can work with komala. If an assault vest user is absolutely needed Komala is outclassed by Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Magearna.",
