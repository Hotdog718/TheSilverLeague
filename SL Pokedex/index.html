      <p id="info">You can use the up and down arrow keys to change the pokemon (Up = next, Down = Previous) or you can click/tap the two buttons on the bottom left corner of the dex.<br>If the pokemon has alternate forms you can use the left and right arrow keys to change the form or click/tap forms.<br>Press S or click/tap on the sprite to change it to shiny and back.<br>You can press Shift or click/tap on the weight/height to change it from metrics to impearial.</p>
      <p style="color: #CFCFCF; font-size: 10px;">Please note that this only has pokemon up to gen 2, gen 3 is currently being added and there is also rockruff, meltan, and melmetal. Feel free to message me on discord (Hotdog#9576) if you find any bugs or have any suggestions.<br>Another Note: I'm not removing pokemon that aren't in the galar dex, that's just too much effort especially since they won't be gone forever.</p>
